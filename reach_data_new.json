        "paperAbstract": "Premature termination (PT) has been identified as widespread in individual, family, and couple therapy. Unfortunately, research on PT utilizes numerous definitions of PT without providing guidance on which definition may be most clinically useful. The current study investigated seven definitions of PT (three based on therapist ratings and four based on quantitative measures) utilizing a sample of 177 couples seeking treatment at two Department of Veterans Affairs medical centers. Results indicated that PT occurred in 50\u201380% of couples; however, agreement between the definitions of PT was generally only in the slight to fair range, making it difficult to determine whether a particular couple was ready to terminate treatment. Additionally, many commonly used definitions of PT were unrelated to level or maintenance of relationship functioning following treatment. In contrast, two definitions of PT (ending treatment in the distressed range and therapist-rated likelihood of future unhappiness) significantly predicted larger decreases in relationship satisfaction during the 18 months following therapy, as well as lower levels of satisfaction and relationship stability 18 months after termination. Additionally, long-term relationship functioning was especially poor when both these definitions of PT were met, suggesting that both qualitative and quantitative definitions should inform decisions about termination in couple therapy.

Our aim was to determine which fit better in two groups of military veterans: peacekeepers previously deployed to a war zone (deployed group) and those trained for peacekeeping operations who were not deployed (nondeployed group). We compared the groups using multigroup confirmatory factor analysis. Adequate model fit was demonstrated among the nondeployed group, with no significant difference between King et al.'s (1998) model (separating avoidance and numbing) and Simms et al.'s (2002) similar model involving a dysphoria factor. A better fitting factor structure consistent with Simms et al.'s (2002) model was found in the deployed group. Comprehensive measurement invariance testing demonstrated significant differences between the deployed and nondeployed groups on all structural parameters, except observed variable intercepts (thus indicating similarities only in PTSD item severity). These findings add to researchers' understanding of PTSD's factor structure, given the revision of PTSD that will appear in the forthcoming 5th edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (American Psychiatric Association, 2010)\u2014namely, that the factor structure may be quite different between groups with and without exposure to major traumatic events.

        "paperAbstract": "Emerging literature shows a consistent pattern of relationship and psychological distress in spouses or partners of combat veterans with symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). One possible mechanism of partners' distress posited in clinical literature is that excessive discussion of traumatic events from deployment may have negative effects on partners. At the extreme, some partners are suggested to develop PTSD-like symptoms, or secondary traumatic stress. Despite these hypotheses, there have been few empirical tests of the effects of communicating about such events. In a sample of 465 combat veterans and their spouses who participated in the Family Interview Component of the National Vietnam Veterans Readjustment Study, we explored how the extent of couples' deployment-related communication was associated with partner relationships and psychological distress, and whether such associations were moderated by the severity of veterans' PTSD symptoms. Results showed that Vietnam-specific communication correlated negatively with relationship distress, but the effect was negligible after controlling for overall communication in the relationship. On the other hand, Vietnam-specific communication did not correlate with psychological distress, but the association was significantly moderated by veterans' PTSD symptom severity. Specifically, communication about Vietnam was increasingly and positively associated with partners' psychological distress as veterans' symptoms of PTSD rose into the clinical range, but nonsignificantly and negatively associated with such distress as PTSD symptoms decreased below this level. The findings support previous clinical recommendations that couples' discussions of potentially traumatic events be approached cautiously, and they suggest a need to attend to the content of couples' communications when conducting dyadic interventions for PTSD.

Lifetime and past-year IPV experiences and current IPV-related posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms were assessed with validated screening measures as part of a 2014 web-based national survey of women veterans. Among 403 respondents, 9.7% (n = 39) identified as LBQ, and 90.3% (n = 364) identified as heterosexual. When controlling for age, LBQ-identified women veterans were significantly more likely to report lifetime sexual and physical IPV and lifetime intimate partner stalking. In the past year, LBQ-identified veterans were twice as likely to endorse emotional mistreatment and physical IPV, and three times more likely to endorse sexual IPV, than were heterosexual-identified women veterans. However, sexual orientation was unrelated to IPV-related PTSD symptoms, when controlling for age, race, and number IPV forms experienced.

Method Participants were 1,301 veterans and active duty soldiers who have served in the military since 09/11/2001; a subsample of these participants (n=482) completed an inventory of current functional social support. Analyses included linear regression and nonparametric bootstrapping procedures. Results After controlling for combat exposure, exposure to childhood trauma was associated with PTSD symptoms in adulthood. Further, PTSD symptoms, and particularly PTSD avoidance/numbing cluster symptoms, intervened in the relationship between childhood trauma and adult functional social support. Conclusions Findings support the association of childhood trauma (both abuse related and other, non-abuse related trauma) with PTSD symptoms in military personnel and veterans, even after accounting for combat exposure. Additionally, the avoidance and numbing symptom cluster of childhood trauma-based PTSD may be particularly salient in compromising one's subsequent ability to garner functional social support in adulthood.",

Studying a sample of 1,203 combat veterans from the National Vietnam Veterans Readjustment Study (NVVRS), this investigation used structural equation modeling (SEM) to test (1) whether experiences of abusive violence are positively directly linked with drug or alcohol problems and suicidality when accounting for traditional combat stressors, and (2) to what extent experiences of abusive violence have positive indirect effects on these postdeployment outcomes via posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and war-related guilt. Overall, 40% of the sample had witnessed or were directly involved in acts of abusive violence while deployed in Vietnam. When controlling for the effects of traditional combat stressors, SEM results revealed that exposure to acts of abusive violence in Vietnam was linked indirectly with substance abuse via PTSD symptoms and both directly and indirectly with suicidality via PTSD symptoms. There was also a significant link between atrocity exposure and war-related guilt in the model, but veterans\u2019 remorse about behavior in Vietnam failed to uniquely predict study outcomes beyond the symptomatology of PTSD. These findings highlight the effects of disproportionate warzone violence on postdeployment mental health, while also suggesting the need for broader conceptual models of combat trauma.

Independent assessments of 240 veteran-partner couples used standardized physical and psychiatric diagnostic interviews that permitted comparison with Australian population data. Multivariate regression modeling examined associations of veterans' war service, combat, and psychiatric status with women's mental health. Anxiety disorders and severe recurrent depression were among 11 of 17 psychiatric diagnoses that were significantly in excess of population expectations. Veterans' combat and post-traumatic stress disorder were significant predictors of women's depressive disorder, particularly severe depression. We conclude that veterans' war service and mental health sequelae including post-traumatic stress disorder are associated with higher rates of mental disorder in their female partners 3 decades after the war.",

        "paperAbstract": "Military mental health has, until recently, been a neglected and marginalized area of interest and although both World Wars saw important advances, in peacetime we typically forget lessons learned in earlier conflicts. Since 2003 however, with high intensity war-fighting on two fronts involving the service personnel of many nations, attention has, once again focused on the immediate and long-term emotional and psychological impact of combat. Whilst we know a lot about posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), much less attention has been paid to a variety of other equally, if not more salient yet superficially less dramatic problems facing service personnel deployed on operations, but which are much more likely to lead to mental disorder than traumatic events and the 'horrors of war'. This article describes some of these broader yet less tangible and under-researched issues and discusses the provision of services for the burgeoning veteran community. The mental health of service personnel and veterans is politically sensitive and attracts significant public and media interest. Understanding and responding appropriately to the needs of this group should be of concern to all mental health professionals and it has important consequences, not only for affected individuals but, for the public perception of mental health services as a whole.",

This paper summarizes the available data about risk and rates of suicide in veterans, including the choice of appropriate comparison groups and the identification of risk factors. The data suggest that taking into account the selection bias of who enters the military (known as the healthy soldier effect), rates of suicide in veterans are higher than expected, especially among activity duty OEF/OIF veterans and even more so among those who experienced injuries and trauma. Thus, the experiences of war and the downstream sequelae, in particular the individuals' psychological reactions and societal responses, lead to suicide risk. This paper describes the VA's response to these data in developing and implementing suicide prevention interventions.",

This paper reviews our current state of knowledge regarding the prevalence and course of this complex condition in past and present members of the defence forces. Although rates vary across conflicts and countries, there is no doubt that PTSD affects substantial numbers of personnel and results in considerable impairment in functioning and quality of life. The paper goes on to discuss recent attempts to build resilience and to promote adjustment following deployment, noting that there is little evidence at this stage upon which to draw firm conclusions. Finally, effective treatment for PTSD is reviewed, with particular reference to the challenges posed by this population in a treatment setting.",

Data was drawn from admission data from the initial episode of treatment of Caucasian and African American Vietnam veterans entering VA specialized intensive PTSD programs between 1993 and 2011 (N = 31,707). Bivariate correlations and logistic regression were used to examine associations among race and incarceration over time and the potentially confounding influence of demographic and clinical covariates on this relationship. Rates of reported incarceration declined from 63 to 43 %. Over time, African American veterans were 34 % more likely than Caucasian veterans to have a lifetime history of incarceration while interaction analysis showed steeper declines for Caucasians than African Americans. Rates of incarceration among these Vietnam veterans declined as they aged. Furthermore, African American veterans were substantially more likely than Caucasian veterans to have been incarcerated and showed less decline as the cohort aged.

Two thousand three hundred and fourteen adolescents, who lived in areas that were the target of multiple missile attacks, completed self-report questionnaires assessing personal characteristics of gender and early traumatic events, subjective exposure (i.e., measures of fear and shortage of basic necessities during the war), objective exposure (i.e., exposure to missile attacks, knowing someone who was wounded or killed) and media exposure. Fifteen percent of the adolescents reported moderate or severe post-traumatic symptoms. Girls and adolescents who experienced earlier traumatic events were at higher risk for distress. While the level of direct exposure contributed to greater distress, the contribution of subjective exposure was significantly stronger. The discussion deals with the unique contribution of both subjective and objective characteristics to post-war adjustment.",

In the current study, the authors investigated IPA assessment among 65 male Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF) and Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF) combat veterans and their female partners. Specifically, we compared overall levels of veteran- and partner-perpetrated IPA, conducted concordance analyses to examine the degree of interpartner agreement on IPA occurrence and frequency, and investigated both veterans\u2019 and partners\u2019 relationship satisfaction and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms as correlates of concordance. Results indicated that female partners perpetrated higher levels of physical IPA than did the male veterans, according to both veteran and combined reports. Concordance analyses revealed low to moderate levels of agreement between veterans and their partners on the perpetration of physical and psychological IPA, with particularly low agreement on the veterans\u2019 physical IPA. Female partners\u2019 relationship satisfaction was associated with reporting less of the veterans\u2019 and their own IPA relative to the veterans\u2019 reports, and their PTSD symptoms were associated with reporting more of the veterans\u2019 and their own IPA. In contrast, the veterans\u2019 PTSD symptoms were associated with reporting less of their own IPA relative to their partners\u2019 reports. The findings emphasize the need for those researching and treating IPA among military couples to assess IPA perpetrated by both members of the relationship and to consider possible factors that might impact the accuracy of IPA reporting.

The present study assesses the longitudinal interrelationship of posttraumatic intrusion and avoidance and family cohesion among 208 Israeli combat veterans from the 1982 Lebanon War. Methods: Two groups of veterans were assessed with self-report questionnaires 1, 3 and 20 years after the war: a combat stress reaction (CSR) group and a matched non-CSR control group. Results: Latent Trajectories Modeling showed that veterans of the CSR group reported higher intrusion and avoidance than non-CSR veterans at all three points of time. With time, there was a decline in these symptoms in both groups, but the decline was more salient among the CSR group. The latter also reported lower levels of family cohesion. Furthermore, an incline in family cohesion levels was found in both groups over the years. Most importantly, Autoregressive Cross-Lagged Modeling among CSR and non-CSR veterans revealed that CSR veterans\u2019 posttraumatic symptoms in 1983 predicted lower family cohesion in 1985, and lower family cohesion, in turn, predicted posttraumatic symptoms in 2002. Conclusions: The findings suggest that psychological breakdown on the battlefield is a marker for future family cohesion difficulties. Our results lend further support for the bi-directional mutual effects of posttraumatic symptoms and family cohesion over time.",

Controlling for demographic and deployment characteristics, spouses who experienced extensions fared worse on an array of measures, including mental well-being (e.g., feelings of depression), household strains (e.g., problems with household and car maintenance), and some areas of their jobs (having to stop work or to work fewer hours). There were no statistically significant differences regarding problems pertaining to their overall health, marriage, other work issues, finances, relationships with Army families, or safety. However, spouses who experienced extensions were more likely to perceive the Army negatively during deployment.

There is no support for the premise that the wife's androgynous qualities allow her to close-out her missing husband more easily from the family system but this is due to the even greater importance of her instrumental qualities in the organization of a father absent family. Although correlational findings indicate that androgyny is significantly and positively related to wife's ease in performing instrumental family roles while PFP relates more to her personal psychological state, regression analyses show that PFP remains the only significant predictor of wife and family function in these families with missing fathers. Though PFP remains a wife-focused variable, it appears to be significant as well in blocking the regenerative power of the entire family system. On the basis of findings from this disaster sample, further study is now warranted using larger, more normative populations of families with ambiguously-absent fathers.",

Longitudinal studies support AS as a vulnerability factor for development of anxiety disorders. This study aimed to investigate AS as a vulnerability factor in the development of childhood posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) following traumatic experiences. Methods: The study included 81 children 8-15 years of age who experienced the 1999 earthquake in Bolu, Turkey. The earthquake survivors were compared to a randomized group of age- and sex-matched controls 5 years after the earthquake. Both the subject and control groups were administered the Childhood Anxiety Sensitivity Index (CASI), State and Trait Anxiety Inventory for Children (STAI-C), and Child Depression Inventory (CDI), while the PTSD symptoms of the subjects were assessed using the Child Posttraumatic Stress Reaction Index (CPTS-RI). Results: Subjects and controls did not differ significantly in CASI, STAI-C, or CDI scores. Multiple regression analysis showed that both trait anxiety and CASI scores predicted CPTS-RI scores of the subjects; the prediction by CASI scores was over and above the effect of trait anxiety. Conclusion: The results of this study support the hypothesis that AS may be a constitutional factor, which might increase the risk of PTSD following traumatic experiences.",

Objective: To assess the association between depressed mood in childhood and alcohol use during adolescence and young adulthood by mood level and sex and race/ethnicity subgroups. Design: Cohort study of individuals observed during late childhood, early adolescence, and young adulthood. Setting: Urban mid-Atlantic region of the United States. Participants: Two successive cohorts of students from 19 elementary schools have been followed up since entry into first grade (1985, cohort I [n = 1196]; 1986, cohort II [n = 1115]). The students were roughly equally divided by sex (48% female) and were predominantly African American (70%). Between 1989 and 1994, annual assessments were performed on students remaining in the public school system, and between 2000 and 2001, approximately 75% participated in an interview at young adulthood (n = 1692). Main Outcome Measures: Among participants who reported having used alcohol, Cox and multinomial regression analyses were used to assess the association of childhood mood level, as measured by a depression symptom screener, with each alcohol outcome (incident alcohol intoxication, incident alcohol-related problems, and DSM-IV alcohol abuse and dependence). Results: In adjusted regression analyses among those who drank alcohol, a high level of childhood depressed mood was associated with an earlier onset and increased risk of alcohol intoxication, alcohol-related problems during late childhood and early adolescence, and development of DSM-IV alcohol dependence in young adulthood. Conclusions: Early manifestations associated with possible depressive conditions in childhood helped predict and account for subsequent alcohol involvement extending across life stages from childhood through young adulthood.",

        "paperAbstract": "Background: The role of women in the U.S. military has changed markedly over the course of 20th- and 21st-century conflicts. Although women frequently occupy healthcare positions in the military, little is known about gender differences in posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) within this occupational subgroup.Materials and Methods: A total of 4275 (667 women and 3608 men) U.S. Navy healthcare personnel supporting military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan were identified from electronic deployment records. Data from Post-Deployment Health Assessments were abstracted to identify PTSD screen positives, and to adjust for self-reported combat exposure and other deployment experiences.Results: The prevalence of PTSD screen positive in the sample was 8.2% (n\u2009=\u2009351/4275). After adjusting for combat exposure, previous psychiatric history, and demographics, women had significantly higher odds of screening positive for PTSD than did men (odds ratio\u2009=\u20091.99, 95% confidence interval 1.34\u20132.96). Interactions between gender and combat exposure, and between gender and previous psychiatric history were not statistically significant.Conclusions: This is one of the first studies to examine gender differences in PTSD among military healthcare personnel. Future research should account for additional stressors, such as long work hours, disrupted sleep patterns, and number of casualties treated. As women are further integrated into military occupations that may lead to different exposures, knowledge of gender differences in the manifestation of PTSD is paramount for prevention and treatment purposes.",

Relatively little research, however, has examined the emotion socialization behaviors that mothers and fathers use to socialize their children\u2019s emotion regulation with respect to how these behaviors may differentially predict depressive symptoms in their sons and daughters. In the current study, the relations among these three variables were investigated by having mothers and fathers report on their children\u2019s dysregulation and regulation coping of anger and sadness. Sons and daughters reported on their perceived receipt of parents\u2019 responses to their anger and sadness expressivity, as well as their own depressive symptoms. Correlational analyses revealed that unsupportive responses to emotional expressivity were related to greater child emotion dysregulation, poorer emotion coping, and depressive symptoms. Moderation analyses revealed that, for both mothers and fathers, at high levels of unsupportive responses to emotions, children were perceived to have more anger dysregulation, less anger coping, less sadness coping, and more depressive symptoms. Regression analyses indicated that mothers\u2019 unsupportive responses to sadness and fathers\u2019 unsupportive responses to anger are associated with their children\u2019s depressive symptoms. These findings support the notion that mothers and fathers play unique roles in children\u2019s emotion regulation skills and subsequent risk for depression.",

This study investigated how day-to-day inconsistency in parental knowledge of youth activities was linked to youth behavioral, psychological, and physical health and parents' stress. Methods Participants were employees in the Information Technology Division of a Fortune 500 company and their children (N\u00a0= 129, mean age of youth\u00a0= 13.39\u00a0years, 55% female). Data were collected from parents and youth via separate workplace and in-home surveys as well as telephone diary surveys on eight consecutive evenings. We assessed day-to-day inconsistency in parental knowledge across these eight calls. Results Parents differed in their knowledge from day to day almost as much as their average knowledge scores differed from those of other parents. Controlling for mean levels of knowledge, youth whose parents exhibited more knowledge inconsistency reported more physical health symptoms (e.g., colds and flu). Knowledge inconsistency was also associated with more risky behavior for girls but greater psychological well-being for older adolescents. Parents who reported more stressors also had higher knowledge inconsistency. Conclusions Assessing only average levels of parental knowledge does not fully capture how this parenting dimension is associated with youth health. Consistent knowledge may promote youth physical health and less risky behavior for girls. Yet knowledge inconsistency also may reflect normative increases in autonomy as it was positively associated with psychological well-being for older adolescents. Given the linkages between parental stress and knowledge inconsistency, parent interventions should include stress management components.",

Of specific interest were relationships of re-employment and financial difficulties to several conditions, such as amount of social support during and after deployment, combat exposure, negative feelings during and after deployment, and postdeployment adjustment symptoms. Survey data from the Army\u2019s Reintegration Unit Risk Inventory were used (4,546 soldiers in 50 units who were deployed during 2010). Few soldiers reported financial difficulties during deployment (7.1% of the sample) and after having returned (11.8%). Of those who reported postdeployment financial difficulties, nearly one-half had reported such difficulties during deployment, and not having resumed the predeployment job was associated with more postdeployment financial difficulties. Logistic regression analyses showed the relative contribution of the study variables to changed financial status, from deployment to postdeployment. Reported deployment support (e.g., trust in the unit chain-of-command and available support) was associated with decreased financial difficulties. In contrast, increased financial difficulties were associated with having seen others wounded or killed in combat. Other postdeployment experiences, such as feelings of anger and frustration and available support, were associated with increased financial difficulties, in addition to alcohol use, trouble sleeping and suicidal thoughts. Implications of results for policy and practice to lessen financial hardships and job loss associated with deployment are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)",

They find that households with nondisabled veterans present have a lower likelihood of poverty, but that advantage is severely eroded when the veteran or another family member has a work-limiting disability. Nevertheless, all veteran households have substantially lower odds of poverty than disabled nonveteran households, which have the highest poverty rate (32.53%). Veteran and disability statuses interact at the household level in ways that contribute to substantial variability in household-level poverty, which has implications for all household members.",

        "paperAbstract": "Background: U.S. military service members die from a variety of causes (i.e., accidents, combat, illnesses, homicide, suicide, and terrorism) while on duty and in greater numbers during times of war, leaving behind bereaved dependent family members. Identifying characteristics of these dependent families improves our understanding of their unique needs, helps educate service providers who offer assistance to these surviving family members, and better informs policy addressing their health and well-being. This study describes deceased U.S. military service members (DSMs) who died on active duty between September 11, 2001 and September 11, 2011 and their surviving dependent spouses and children.; Methods: Characteristics of DSMs (service branch, rank, and cause of death) and characteristics of spouse-with-children and spouse-only families (ages of dependents, time since loss, and distance from a military installation) were examined.; Results: 15,938 DSMs died from a variety of causes (e.g., accidents, combat, and illnesses). 55% of DSMs had dependent spouses and 56% of those spouses had children. Most surviving dependent spouses and children were young (mean ages = 32.8, 10.3 years; SD = 9.3, 7.3 years, respectively) at the time of DSM death. Many of these young dependents were related to a DSM who experienced a sudden and violent death. 60% of spouse-with-children families and 58% of spouse-only families lived farther than 60 miles from a military installation. Time since loss (range = 1.3-11.3 years) did not predict distance to installation.; Conclusions: Findings characterize surviving spouses and their children, suggest potential risk for problematic grief outcomes, and underscore the importance of educating service providers about how to support military survivor family health and resilience.; Reprint & Copyright \u00a9 2017 Association of Military Surgeons of the U.S.",

Method: Participants were 468 Army National Guard fathers from a brigade combat team (mean age \u03ed 36 years; median deployment length \u03ed 16 months; 89% European American, 5% African American, 6% Hispanic American). Participants completed an in-theater survey 1 month before returning home from Operation Iraqi Freedom deployment (Time 1) and again 1 year postdeployment (Time 2). The PTSD Checklist\u2014Military Version (PCL\u2013M; Weathers, Litz, Herman, Huska, & Keane, 1993) was gathered at both times, and 2 items assessing social support were gathered at baseline only. At Time 2, participants also completed self-report measures of parenting (Alabama Parenting Questionnaire\u2014Short Form; Elgar, Waschbusch, Dadds, & Sigvaldason, 2007), couple adjustment (Dyadic Adjustment Scale\u20147; Sharpley & Rogers, 1984; Spanier, 1976), parent\u2013 child relationship quality (4 items from the Social Adjustment Scale\u2014Self-Report; Weissman & Bothwell, 1976), alcohol use (Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test; Babor, Higgins-Biddle, Saunders, & Monteiro, 2001), and items assessing injuries sustained while deployed. Results: Structural equation modeling analyses showed that increases in PTSD symptoms were associated with poorer couple adjustment and greater perceived parenting challenges at Time 2 (both at p \u03fd .001). Furthermore, PTSD symptoms predicted parenting challenges independent of their impact on couple adjustment. Conclusions: Findings highlight the importance of investigating and intervening to support parenting and couple adjustment among combat-affected National Guard families.",

        "paperAbstract": "Mood disorders affect large numbers of individuals and their families; the ripple effects on relationship functioning can be great. Researchers have advocated for a relational perspective to mood disorder treatment, and several promising treatments have been developed. However, few rigorous evaluations have been conducted within the Veterans Affairs (VA) system. Multifamily group therapy, an evidence-based practice for people living with schizophrenia, has recently been adapted for other psychological disorders with promising results. This report describes the first published evaluation of this treatment modality in the VA system for veterans living with mood disorders. 101 male veterans (74 with major depression and 27 with bipolar disorder) and their family members participated in REACH (Reaching out to Educate and Assist Caring, Healthy Families), a 9-month, manualized, multi-family group treatment, intervention adapted from McFarlane's original multi-family group model. Participants completed self-report questionnaires at four time points across the course of the treatment, and service utilization data for veterans were obtained from VA databases. Both veterans and family members showed improvements in their knowledge about mood disorders, understanding of positive strategies for dealing with situations commonly confronted in mood disorders, and family coping strategies. Veterans also evidenced improvement in family communication and problem-solving behaviors, empowerment, perceived social support, psychiatric symptoms, and overall quality of life. The REACH intervention holds promise as a feasible, acceptable, and effective treatment for veterans living with mood disorders and their families. Further study is warranted.",

METHOD: Data were collected from Caucasian veterans with PTSD (N = 1,822) and their partners (N = 702); mean age = 53.9 years, SD = 7.36. Veterans completed the Posttraumatic Checklist Military Version (PCL-M) and, along with their partners, completed the McMaster Family Assessment Device (FAD-12). Assessments were conducted at intake into a treatment program at 3 months and 9 months posttreatment. RESULTS: Structural equation models (SEMs) were developed for veterans as well as for veterans and their partners. Poor family functioning for veterans at intake predicted intrusion (beta = .08), hyperarousal (beta = .07), and avoidance (beta = .09) at 3 months posttreatment. At 3 months posttreatment, family functioning predicted hyperarousal (beta = .09) and avoidance (beta = .10) at 9 months. For veterans and their partners, family functioning at intake predicted avoidance (beta = .07) at 3 months, and poor family functioning at 3 months predicted intrusion (beta = .09) and hyperarousal (beta = .14) at 9 months. The reverse pathways, with PTSD symptoms predicting poor family functioning, were only evident with avoidance (beta = .06). CONCLUSION: Family functioning may play a role in treatment for veterans.",

This study examined perceptions of everyday talk, topic avoidance, and stress of participants romantically involved with (a) a military partner (n = 118) or (b) a non-military partner (n = 94). Couple types avoided similar topics, but non-military partners avoided these topics more frequently than military partners. Both couple types engaged in everyday talk, but military partners found this communicative exchange to be more important. Non-military partners experienced greater stress than military partners, and communication was predictive of the stress experienced.

Quantitative analyses (one-way analysis of variance [ANOVA]; t test) indicated differences in attitude toward the adoption of evidence-based practices across service line, but not role (staff vs. supervisor), with wraparound staff being more open and willing to implement evidence-based practices. Qualitative data were coded by 2 independent coders. Four themes emerged: include training support from trainers, agencies, supervisors, and peers within and across departments; use interactive training methods rather than lecture-based formats; schedule and structure training sessions with an appreciation of the time constraints upon practitioners; and offer training in content areas that are both efficacious and of interest.

We used a random sample of Iraq and Afghanistan War era veterans from the National Post-Deployment Adjustment Survey in 2009\u20132011.Results. Veterans were randomly selected from a roster of all US military service members in Operation Iraqi Freedom or Operation Enduring Freedom who were separated from active duty or in the Reserves/National Guard. Veterans (n\u2009=\u20091090) from 50 states and all military branches completed 2 waves of data collection 1 year apart (79% retention rate). Thirty percent reported money mismanagement (e.g., bouncing or forging a check, going over one\u2019s credit limit, falling victim to a money scam in the past year). Multivariate analysis revealed money mismanagement (odds ratio [OR]\u2009=\u20094.09, 95% CI\u2009=\u20091.87, 8.94) was associated with homelessness in the next year, as were arrest history (OR\u2009=\u20092.65, 95% CI\u2009=\u20091.33, 5.29), mental health diagnosis (OR\u2009=\u20092.59, 95% CI\u2009=\u20091.26, 5.33), and income (OR\u2009=\u20090.30, 95% CI\u2009=\u20090.13, 0.71).Conclusions. Money mismanagement, reported by a substantial number of veterans, was related to a higher rate of subsequent homelessness. The findings have implications for policymakers and clinicians, suggesting that financial education programs offered by the US Departments of Defense and Veterans Affairs may be targeted to effectively address veteran homelessness.",

In the present study, the reciprocal relationship between parenting behavior and children\u2019s socially competent behaviors were examined. Using the National Institute of Child Health and Development Study of Early Child Care data set (NICHD Early Child Care Research Network, 2005), bidirectional relationships between parental sensitivity and children\u2019s prosocial behavior were modeled using latent variables in structural equation modeling for mothers and fathers, separately. Children and their parents engaged in structured interactions when children were 54-month-olds, 3rd graders, and 5th graders, and these interactions were coded for parental sensitivity. At 3rd, 5th, and 6th grades, teachers and parents reported on children\u2019s prosocial behavior. Parental education and child gender were entered as covariates in the models. The results provide support for a bidirectional relationship between children\u2019s prosocial behavior and maternal sensitivity (but not paternal sensitivity) in middle childhood. The importance of using a bidirectional approach to examine the development of social competence is emphasized. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)",

        "paperAbstract": "Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is prevalent among users of the Veterans Affairs (VA) health care system. Effective approaches to involving family in care for PTSD are critical because family functioning both affects and is affected by treatment outcomes. Although multifamily group treatment is an evidence-based practice for schizophrenia and other serious mental illnesses, no data have been published on its effectiveness for those living with PTSD and their family members. This study examined the impact of participation in REACH (Reaching out to Educate and Assist Caring, Healthy Families), an adaptation of the multifamily group psychoeducation program tailored for delivery to veterans with PTSD and their family members. One hundred veterans with PTSD and 96 family members who participated in the 9-month, 3-phase clinical program between 2006 and 2010 also participated in this longitudinal evaluation. Veterans showed significant (p < .05) improvements over time on all measures (empowerment, family problem solving and communication, relationship satisfaction, social support, symptom status, knowledge of PTSD, self-efficacy in coping with PTSD, and quality of life). Family members showed similar statistically significant improvements on most measures. Changes over time in individual participants\u2019 relationship satisfaction, social support, symptom status, and quality of life were attributable to changes in program-targeted knowledge and skills. Study results suggest that multifamily group psychoeducation is useful in treatment of PTSD, leading to increases in targeted PTSD knowledge and skills, as well as improving family functioning and symptom status for both veterans and family members. Implications for clinicians and recommendations for further evaluation of this promising intervention are described. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)",

Our study sought to (a) identify rates of self-reported posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and depression symptoms during combat deployment, (b) characterize higher order dimensions of emotional distress experienced by soldiers during deployment, and (c) identify predictors of these dimensions of emotional distress. Method: Participants were 2677 National Guard soldiers deployed as part of Operation Iraqi Freedom in 2006\u201307. We performed a principal components factor analysis on items of the PTSD Checklist\u2014Military Version and the Beck Depression Inventory to identify dimensions of emotional distress, followed by multiple regression analyses to identify factors that predicted these dimensions of distress. Results: Rates of PTSD and depression in our sample were 7% and 9%, respectively. Five dimensions of emotional distress emerged: negative affect/cognitions, trauma-specific re-experiencing and avoidance, vegetative symptoms, loss of interest/numbing symptoms, and arousal/irritability. Two dimensions, trauma-specific symptoms and arousal/irritability, appeared to be more indicative of trauma sequelae, while the other three dimensions were more indicative of depressive symptoms. Demographic factors, combat exposure (including injury and exposure to explosive blast), and attitudinal variables predicted trauma-specific aspects of distress. Symptoms characteristic of depression or generalized distress were predicted by female gender, recent prior deployment, and attitudinal factors but were not predicted by blast exposure or injury. Conclusions: These findings suggest specific targets for contextual and individual interventions to reduce deployment-related distress and point out the need for longitudinal follow-up to determine long-term implications for post-deployment functioning.",

Findings documented multiple avenues through which child care providers help to scaffold infants\u2019 naturally occurring social encounters with their peers, including creating opportunities for peer interaction, preventing and interrupting peer interaction, communicating to children about their peers and peer relations, providing direct instructions and rules for peer interaction, and modeling social behavior during group interactions.

To help focus prevention strategies, we characterized 56 US Army suicides that occurred from 2005 to 2007 in 17 US states using 2 large-scale surveillance systems. We found that intimate partner problems and military-related stress, particularly job stress, were common among decedents. Many decedents were also identified as having suicidal ideation, a sad or depressed mood, or a recent crisis before death. Focusing efforts to prevent these forms of stress might reduce suicides among soldiers.",

Although existing literature demonstrates that developmental benefits are associated with religion for adolescents, little is understood about the dynamics of this relationship. Drawing on social capital theory, this study tested a conceptual model exploring socially embedded religious influences on moral outcomes. A three-dimensional model of social capital demonstrated how social interaction, trust, and shared vision enable social ties associated with religiousness to influence moral behavior. Structural equation modeling was used with data gathered from 735 urban youths to test a proposed model of the effects of religiousness on moral outcomes. Results suggested that religiously active youths report higher levels of social capital resources and that the influence of adolescent religiousness on moral outcomes was mediated through social capital resources.

To improve the availability of couple-based treatment for couples with IPV, the present study sought to determine whether associations with IPV found in community samples generalized to couples seeking help for their relationship and whether web-based interventions for relationship distressed worked equally well for couples with IPV. In the first aim, in a sample of 2,797 individuals who were seeking online help for their relationship, the levels and correlates of both low-intensity and clinically significant IPV largely matched what is found in community samples. In the second aim, in a sample of 300 couples who were randomly assigned to a web-based intervention or a waitlist control group, low-impact IPV did not moderate the effects of the intervention for relationship distress. Therefore, web-based interventions may be an effective (and easily accessible) intervention for relationship distress for couples with low-intensity IPV.",

Qualitative analyses identified 5 categories and 12 subcategories of dilemmas that reflected distinct types of considerations (e.g., youth\u2019s personalities, relationships with the community). The analyses also found that the experienced leaders in the study typically responded to these dilemmas in ways that were youth-centered and that balanced multiple considerations. It is argued that researchers need to go beyond identifying features of high quality programs, and more fully examine how effective leaders create and sustain high quality in response to the challenging situations of practice.",

However, there are few studies that examine changes in women Veterans\u2019 stressors before and after deployment.OBJECTIVEThis study examines the types of stressors women Veterans report before deployment, immediately after deployment, 3 months after deployment, and 1 year post-deployment.DESIGNDescriptive data on reported stressors was collected at four time points of a longitudinal study (HEROES Project). Open-ended responses from the Coping Response Inventory (CRI) were coded into six possible major stressor categories for analysis.PARTICIPANTSSeventy-nine Army National Guard and Reserve female personnel deploying to Operation Enduring Freedom (OFF)/Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF) were surveyed prior to deployment. Of these participants, 35 women completed Phase 2, 41 completed Phase 3, and 48 completed Phase 4 of the study.KEY RESULTSWe identified six major stressor categories: (1) interpersonal (i.e., issues with family and/or friends), (2) deployment-related and military-related, (3) health concerns, (4) death of a loved one, (5) daily needs (i.e., financial/housing/transportation concerns), and (6) employment or school-related concerns. At all time points, interpersonal issues were one of the most common type of stressor for this sample. Daily needs concerns increased from 3 months post-deployment to 1 year post-deployment.CONCLUSIONSInterpersonal concerns are commonly reported by women Veterans both before and after their combat experience, suggesting that this is a time during which interpersonal support is especially critical. We discuss implications, which include the need for a more coordinated approach to women Veterans\u2019 health care (e.g., greater community-based outreach), and the need for more and more accessible Veterans Affairs (VA) services to address the needs of female Veterans.",

In addition to the high rates of psychological and behavioral challenges among military personnel, there are other equally important post-deployment reintegration challenges. Post-deployment reintegration challenges are particularly important to Reserve and Guard members, who transition rapidly from civilian-military-civilian.\nOBJECTIVE: This study aims to describe the scope of challenges that a battalion of National Guard members (NGM) report experiencing after returning from a one-year deployment to Iraq.\nMETHOD: This article reports data from a sample of 126 NGM who recently returned from a one-year deployment to Iraq. The scope of post-deployment problems at baseline, 3- and 6-month post-deployment are presented.\nRESULTS: Overall, the rates of post-deployment psychological and behavioral problems were elevated upon returning from deployment and remained fairly constant for up to 6 months post-deployment. Approximately 30% of respondents were unsatisfied with their relationship and upwards of 30% reported family reintegration challenges.\nCONCLUSIONS: Comparisons with similar research and implications for prevention and improvement of post-deployment quality of life are addressed.",

Despite available treatments, rates of recovery are poor and many symptoms persist post-treatment. Previous research suggests that exercise functions to reduce symptoms of anxiety and improve sleep quality, though its effects are understudied among those with PTSD. Method We sought to assess the extent to which exercise and sleep interactively impact changes in PTSD severity. Participants were 217 veterans in residential PTSD treatment who were offered the opportunity to participate in a bike-exercise program. Data were collected at treatment intake and discharge. Results Exercise (defined as total volume of cycling completed over the course of treatment) was associated with greater reductions in PTSD hyperarousal symptoms at discharge only among veterans with poor intake sleep quality. Conclusions Overall, exercise may be a beneficial adjunctive treatment for reducing hyperarousal symptoms among individuals with PTSD and poor sleep.",

This article reports on a study of 605 adolescents (aged 12\u201317 years) who were concurrent clients of two or more service systems (child welfare, juvenile justice, additional education, mental health). It was hypothesised that services adopting PYD approaches would be related to increases in youth resilience and better wellbeing outcomes. It was also hypothesised that risks, resilience, service experiences and wellbeing outcomes would differ by age, gender and ethnicity. Youth completed a self-report questionnaire administered individually. Path analysis was used to determine the relationship between risk, service use, resilience and a wellbeing outcome measure. MANOVA was then used to determine patterns of risk, service use, resilience and wellbeing among participants based on their demographic characteristics. Services using PYD approaches were significantly related to higher levels of youth resilience. Similarly, increased resilience was related to increased indicators of wellbeing, suggesting the mediating role of resilience between risk factors and wellbeing outcomes. When professionals adopt PYD practices and work with the positive resources around youth (their own resilience processes) interventions can make a significant contribution to wellbeing outcomes for at-risk youth.",

Method: Participants are 253 older persons (mean age: 79.8, standard deviation: 2.1; 73.9% women) from the Rush Memory and Aging Project, a clinicopathologic study of common chronic conditions of old age. Childhood adversity was assessed with a 16-item measure based on portions of the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire and other inventories. Psychosocial adjustment was assessed with multiple measures of neuroticism (i.e., proneness to negative emotions) and social engagement. Results: Based in part on a factor analysis, composite measures of total adversity, emotional neglect, parental intimidation, parental violence, family turmoil, and financial need were developed. In a series of linear regression models adjusted for age, sex, own education, and parental education, the composite measure of childhood adversity was associated with all facets of neuroticism and accounted for more than 13% of the variance in the composite neuroticism measure. Emotional neglect and parental intimidation had the strongest associations with neuroticism. Childhood adversity was not related to frequency of participation in social activities, but more adversity was associated with having a smaller network (accounting for 3% of the variance) and feeling more emotionally isolated (accounting for 7% of the variance). Conclusion: Childhood adversity is associated with less adaptive psychosocial functioning in old age.",

        "paperAbstract": "The worst peacetime disaster in United States Army history occurred on December 12, 1985 in Gander, Newfoundland. A charter airline carrying 248 soldiers home from peacekeeping duties in the Sinai Desert crashed after a refueling stop, killing all on board. After the crash, Army family assistance workers were appointed to help the surviving family members of each dead soldier. While substantial attention has been paid to the impact of sudden disasters on survivors and bereaved relatives, little is known about the health risks to those who perform helper roles. This study aimed to: a) identify the major stress areas for disaster family assistance workers; b) examine the relation between degree of exposure to these stressors and health; and c) locate risk factors, or resistance resources that might modulate any ill effects of exposure. A survey instrument assessed duration and intensity of family-helping activities and psychological well-being, psychiatric symptoms, major illness indicators, and social and personality variables at 6 months after the crash and again at the 1-year point for 131 family assistance officers. Results indicate a dose-response effect between exposure measured at time 1 and well-being, symptoms, and illness at time 2. Analysis of covariance findings also show that social supports (work supervisors, family, and friends) modulate the effects of exposure on symptoms and well-being. Social supports and the personality style of hardiness (or dispositional resilience) interact to modulate the effects of exposure on illness. These results demonstrate: a) a delayed negative impact of helper stress on family assistance workers, and b) a protective function of social supports and personality hardiness. Further research in this area should thus consider the potential influence of social/situational variables and personality dispositions in coping with disaster helper stress.",

Semi-structured, face-to-face interviews were conducted with 10 employed mothers whose partners had been deployed for at least a six-month period. Findings indicated that the loss of daily support from partners and concern for partners\u2019 safety contributed to women shifting their focus from individual to family leisure as a means of coping and caring for their children.",

An existing evidence-based behavioral intervention, the Strengthening Families Program: For Parents and Youth 10\u201314 (SFP), was adapted to include concepts and activities related to mindfulness and mindful parenting (an extension of mindfulness to the interpersonal domain of parent\u2013child relationships). The foundation for this innovative intervention approach stems from research on the effects of mind-body treatments involving mindfulness meditation and the function of stress and coping in relation to parenting and parent well-being. One group of families participated in a seven-week pilot of this mindfulness-enhanced version of SFP. Results of a mixed-method implementation evaluation suggest that the new intervention activities were generally feasible to deliver, acceptable to participants, and perceived to yield positive bene\ufb01ts for family functioning and parent psychological well-being. The next phase of this research will involve curriculum re\ufb01nement based upon results of this initial study, and a larger pilot ef\ufb01cacy trial will be conducted.",

Independent evaluation of individual outcome measures revealed that yoga participants showed statistically significant differences over time relative to controls on measures of anger control and fatigue/inertia. Most outcome measures exhibited a pattern of worsening in the control group over time, whereas changes in the yoga group over time were either minimal or showed slight improvements.

MBCP is a formal adaptation of the Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction program and was developed and refined over the course of 11 years of clinical practice with 59 groups of expectant couples. MBCP is designed to promote family health and well-being through the practice of mindfulness during pregnancy, childbirth, and early parenting. Quantitative results from the current study include statistically significant increases in mindfulness and positive affect, and decreases in pregnancy anxiety, depression, and negative affect from pre- to post-test (p < .05). Effect sizes for changes in key hypothesized intervention mediators were large (d > .70), suggesting that MBCP is achieving its intended effects on maternal well-being during pregnancy. Qualitative reports from participants expand upon the quantitative findings, with the majority of participants reporting perceived benefits of using mindfulness practices during the perinatal period and early parenting. Our future research will involve conducting a randomized controlled trial of MBCP to test effects on psychophysiological stress mechanisms and to examine effects on birth outcomes, family relationship quality, and child development outcomes.",

Thirty-five veterans (9.6 %) identified as gay or lesbian (4.7 %), or bisexual (4.9 %).Main MeasuresMeasures included sexual orientation, military sexual trauma, mental and gender-specific health diagnoses, and VA healthcare utilization and satisfaction.Key ResultsLB OEF/OIF veterans were significantly more likely to have experienced both military and childhood sexual trauma than heterosexual women (MST: 31 % vs. 13 %, p < .001; childhood sexual trauma: 60 % vs. 36 %, p = .01), to be hazardous drinkers (32 % vs. 16 %, p = .03) and rate their current mental health as worse than before deployment (35 % vs. 16 %, p < .001).ConclusionsMany LB veterans have experienced sexual victimization, both within the military and as children, and struggle with substance abuse and poor mental health. Health care providers working with female Veterans should be aware of high rates of military sexual trauma and childhood abuse and refer women to appropriate VA treatment and support groups for sequelae of these experiences. Future research should focus on expanding this study to include a larger and more diverse sample of lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender veterans receiving care at VA facilities across the country.",

        "paperAbstract": "Introduction: Intimate partner violence (IPV) occurs across the world, in various cultures, and affects people across societies irrespective of economic status or gender. Most data on IPV before World Health Organization multicountry study (WHOMCS) usually came from sources other than the military. Result of this study will contribute to the existing body of knowledge and may serve as a baseline for future studies in military populations. This study compares the prevalence of the different types of IPV against women in military and civilian communities in Abuja, Nigeria.; Methods: Using a multistage sampling technique, 260 women who had intimate male partners were selected from military and civilian communities of Abuja. Collected data on personal characteristics and different types of IPV experienced were analyzed to demonstrate comparison of the association between the different forms of IPV and the respondents' sociodemographic and partner characteristics in the two study populations using percentages and \u03c7-square statistics, and P-value was assumed to be significant at \u22640.05.; Results: The prevalence of the four major types of IPV was higher among the military respondents than among civilians: controlling behavior, 37.1% versus 29.1%; emotional/psychological abuse, 42.4% versus 13.4%; physical abuse, 19.7% versus 5.9%, and sexual abuse, 9.2% versus 8.8%. Significantly more respondents from the military population (59 [45.4%]) compared to civilians (21 [19.4%]) were prevented by their partners from seeing their friends (P=0.000). The situation is reversed with regard to permission to seek health care for self, with civilians reporting a significantly higher prevalence (35 [32.4%]) than did military respondents (20 [15.4%]) (P=0.002). The military respondents were clearly at a higher risk of experiencing all the variants of emotional violence than the civilians (P=0.00). The commonest form of physical violence against women was \"being slapped or having something thrown at them, that could hurt\", which was markedly higher in the military (43 [33.1%]) than in the civilian population (10 [9.3%]), (P<0.05).; Conclusion: IPV is a significant public health problem in Abuja, and the military population is clearly at a higher risk of experiencing all forms of IPV compared to the civilian population. The military should encourage and finance research on effect of military operations and posttraumatic stress disorders on family relationships with a view of developing evidence-based treatment models for military personnel.;",

The aim of the present study was to explore patterns of MH service utilization within the first 12 months following return from combat deployment. Participants were 169 service members who had returned from war-zone deployment in either Iraq or Afghanistan and had assessments covering a 12-month period following their homecoming. The authors first examined the prevalence of mental health diagnoses and engagement with mental health treatment (e.g., visits to the emergency room, inpatient hospitalization, individual therapy, group therapy, family or couple therapy, medication appointments, and self-help). Regression analyses explored whether distress, functioning, diagnoses, or social support predicted treatment use. Findings indicated that 28 of 50 military service members (56%) who met diagnostic criteria for a mental health disorder accessed services in the year following their return from deployment. Individual treatment was the most common modality, and those with major depressive disorder (MDD) reported the most treatment contacts. Social support was not associated with use of mental health services. Baseline functioning and psychiatric distress predicted entry into treatment whereas only psychiatric distress predicted amount of mental health service use in the 12-month postdeployment period. Findings highlight the need for enhanced strategies to link those reporting psychiatric distress with MH treatment services and increase community connectedness regardless of whether they meet full criteria for a mental health diagnosis.",

This paper presents the rationale, key considerations, and feasibility for adapting the Marriage Checkup (MC), a brief intervention for enhancing marital resiliency, for use by internal behavioral health consultants (IBHCs) working in an integrated primary care clinic serving an active duty military population. We detail the adapted MC protocol, which was revised to contain military-centric content and fit into the fast-paced environment of primary care (e.g., streamlined to fit within three 30-minute appointments). IBHCs working in primary care were trained to offer the intervention at two air force bases. Twenty couples and 1 individual have completed the MC and a 1-month follow-up assessment. The MC intervention appeared to be well-received by both couples and IBHCs. In this paper, we provide specific guidance for clinicians and providers who are interested in integrating the Marriage Checkup into their practice.",

Objective: This study evaluated a Sesame Workshop multimedia kit called: Talk, Listen, Connect: Changes (TLC-II(C); 2008). The kit, which included video and print materials, aimed to help caregivers (i.e., at-home partner, at-home relative or family member of a current or discharged military member) assist young children as they adjusted to their parent's injury. We expected that the materials would be used and their quality evaluated. We hypothesized that use of the materials would produce improvements in caregiver and child outcomes as well as reductions in perceptions of disruption in the home. We also predicted that kit-use would have a positive impact on the family. Methods: One-hundred and fifty three families with children aged 2\u20138 years were randomly assigned to receive the kit being evaluated (TLC-II(C)) or a control kit (Healthy Habits for Life (HHL)), also developed by Sesame Workshop. Group outcomes were compared four weeks following receipt of the kits using multivariate analysis of variance. Results: All materials were well used and highly rated. All caregivers reported less social isolation, less child aggression, and significantly less disruptive home environments after kit use. Test group caregivers reported significantly greater reductions in depressive symptoms and significant increases in children's social competence over time in comparison to the control group. Conclusions: These results signal important improvements among families as a consequence of using either test or control materials. As a preventative intervention designed for families with an injured member, TLC-II(C) was particularly effective at improving coping. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)",

        "paperAbstract": "Introduction: Studies have shown that parents of children with pervasive developmental disorders (PDD) exhibit higher levels of stress than parents of typically developing children or children with other types of developmental delays (DD). This relationship appears to be mediated by elevated levels of behavior problems observed in children with PDD. However, little is known about what specific child behavior problems are most common in this population or how these behavior problems relate to parental stress. We examined the relationship between parenting stress and child behavior problems in parents of young children with PDD. Method: The current study utilized data from the Mindful Awareness for Parenting Stress (MAPS) project and included 72 parents of children with PDD. The mean age of the parents in the current study was 34.81 years (SD = 7.67) and the mean age of the children was 3.86 years (SD = 0.98). Results: The most commonly endorsed classes of child behavior problems included attention problems, language problems, and externalizing behavior problems. Three specific behavior problems, \u201cDoesn\u2019t answer when people talk to him/her,\u201d \u201cSpeech problem,\u201d and \u201cTemper tantrums or hot temper,\u201d were significantly related to parental stress levels at intake. Furthermore, these three behavior problems uniquely predicted parenting stress. Conclusions: Identifying the behavior problems that are most difficult for parents to handle may allow clinicians to tailor interventions to the specific needs of families. The current study indicated that social difficulties, speech problems, and tantrums have the greatest negative impact on parental stress, highlighting these problems as ideal targets for interventions.",

Information about age, gender, education level, duration of time since amputation, duration of care provided by the spouses and SF-36 questionnaire for both veterans and their spouses were collected.\nResults: The average age of spouses was 47 years and duration of care provided by spouses was 25 years. We found lower scores for general health domains in amputees' spouses compared to the general population. Factors correlated with both Physical Component Summary (PCS) and Mental Component Summary (MCS) included the duration of care, duration of marriage, spouses' education level and the veterans' PCS and MCS scores. Veterans' age, spouses' age and the number of children only correlated with PCS. Veterans' education level only correlated with MCS. In multivariable analysis, only spouses' education level correlated with MCS and the veterans' PCS only correlated with that of spouses.\nConclusions: The quality of life of amputees and their spouses were closely correlated; therefore, any improvement in one is likely to improve the other. In addition, lower education level should be considered as a risk factor for poorer quality of life in amputees' spouses.",

        "paperAbstract": "The intimate partners of veterans living with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) often have few opportunities to articulate in their own words how the disorder affects them and their families. Besides relationship challenges and stress associated with assuming a caregiver role, partners may endure their own psychological distress. These occurrences may be overlooked when treating PTSD, as the focus is usually on the veteran and from the veteran\u2019s perspective. Engaging significant others and understanding their perspective is paramount to both the veteran\u2019s recovery and the well-being of the couple. We mailed surveys to partners of veterans with PTSD as part of a larger study that assessed PTSD-related knowledge, beliefs, treatment involvement, and quality of life. At the end of the survey was an optional free-text section inviting partners to share any other information related to their circumstances. Of all survey respondents, over half (n = 252) provided comments. We used this opportunity to explore these partners\u2019 experiences of living with a veteran diagnosed with PTSD. Using a thematic analysis framework, independent raters coded comments relating to relationships, partner/family reactions, protective factors, mental health services, reactions to study participation, and general remarks. Findings highlighted the myriad ways in which PTSD impacts both partners and families, strategies partners use to cope, and specific mental health services they believe would be most beneficial. Responses suggested a continued need to include partner perspectives in future work, and to provide mental health services targeted to partners of veterans with PTSD.

For deployed parents, conversation orientation was associated with fewer reported child behavioral problems and more prosocial child behavior during the reunion period, suggesting that conversation orientation serves as a protective factor as service members reintegrate into the family. At-home parents\u2019 reports of conversation orientation were not significantly associated with their reports of child difficulties or prosocial behavior.

The current study examined spouses of National Guard soldiers recently returned from deployments in Iraq. In addition to documenting elevated levels of psychological symptoms in these spouses, the authors found that spouses experienced greater symptom severity when they perceived high levels of symptoms in soldiers but the soldiers endorsed low levels of symptoms. Furthermore, spouses\u2019 marital satisfaction was negatively linked to soldiers\u2019 self-reported symptom severity only when spouses perceived that soldiers had experienced low levels of combat activity while deployed. When spouses perceived high levels of such activity, soldiers\u2019 self-reported symptoms had no relationship with spouses\u2019 marital satisfaction. These \ufb01ndings highlight the importance of interpersonal perceptions in intimate relationships and are consistent with the notion that uncontrollable attributions for a relative\u2019s mental health problems may provide a buffer against relationship distress.",

The program is aimed at preventing depressive and anxiety symptoms and disorders in middle primary school children aged 9\u201310 years. Students from 22 low SES primary schools (N\u00a0=\u00a0910) were randomly assigned to an intervention or a control group and assessed at baseline, post-test, 6 months and 18 months. The intervention group received the program implemented by teachers and the control group received their regular Health Education curriculum. Students completed questionnaires on depression, anxiety, and attribution style. At risk students were further assessed with the computerised Diagnostic Interview for Children and Adolescents. Parents reported on their children's externalising and internalising problems at home. Children in the intervention condition reported a significant pre-post reduction in depressive symptoms, and there was a significant pre-post reduction in parent-reported emotional difficulties which was maintained at 6 month follow-up; no changes were evident in the control group. Both groups showed significant improvements in child-reported anxiety and attribution style, and significant improvements in parent-reported pro-social behaviours. For both groups, there were no significant post-baseline changes in incidence and recovery rates for depression, anxiety, or internalising symptoms. These findings suggest that AOP-PTS has the potential to treat depressive symptomatology in the immediate term but the effects were not sustained. There is also evidence of improved emotional resilience up to 6 months following the program. Further follow-up to investigate longer term effects is needed.",

NPSP mothers are classified as \u201clow needs\u201d (LN) or \u201chigh needs\u201d (HN) based on their Family Needs Screener (FNS) responses and NPSP service providers\u2019 clinical judgment. Using data from 112,478 mothers, we analyzed classifications based on FNS scores, classifications based on NPSP service providers\u2019 clinical judgments, and whether these classifications predicted mothers\u2019 subsequent maltreatment of a child. Overall, 75% of mothers were classified as LN based on their FNS responses. Clinical judgments resulted in overrides for the classifications of 6% of cases and, when overrides occurred, mothers\u2019 classifications were more likely changed from LN to HN than vice versa. Further, both FNS-based HN classifications and clinical overrides from LN to HN predicted subsequent child maltreatment. These data suggest FNS and clinical overrides are useful for predicting child maltreatment within USAF families.",

        "paperAbstract": "Introduction Traumatic brain injury (TBI) and substance use are highly prevalent conditions among military populations. There is a significant body of evidence that suggests greater approval of substance use (i.e., norms) is related to increased substance use. The objective of this work is to understand the impact of TBI and military service on substance use norms of soldiers and their partners. Data are from the baseline assessment of Operation: SAFETY, an ongoing, longitudinal study of US Army Reserve/National Guard (USAR/NG) soldiers and their partners. Methods Multiple regression models examined associations between alcohol, tobacco, illicit drug use, and non-medical use of prescription drug (NMUPD) norms within and across partners based on current military status (CMS) and TBI. Results Male USAR/NG soldiers disapproved of NMUPD, illicit drug use and tobacco use. There was no relation between military status and alcohol use. Among females, there was no relation between CMS and norms. The NMUPD norms of wives were more likely to be approving if their husbands reported TBI symptoms and had separated from the military. Husbands of soldiers who separated from the military with TBI had greater approval of the use of tobacco, NMUPD, and illicit drugs. Conclusion Overall, there is evidence to suggest that, while generally disapproving of substance use, soldiers and partners become more accepting of use if they also experience TBI and separate from the military. Future research should examine the longitudinal influence of TBI on substance use norms and subsequent changes in substance use over time.",

This study consisted of a retrospective chart review of 603 patients admitted to a psychiatric ward during a period of 1 year at Atlanta Veterans Affairs Medical Center who had data on childhood physical and sexual abuse. The prevalence of reported childhood physical or sexual abuse in this inpatient clinical population was 19.4% (117/603). The prevalence of reported physical abuse was 22.6% (19/84) in the women and 12.0% (62/519) in the men (p = 0.008); the prevalence of sexual abuse was 33.3% (28/84) in the women and 7.7% (40/519) in the men (p < 0.0001). More patients with depressive disorders reported sexual abuse than did those without these disorders. More patients with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) reported physical and sexual abuse than did those without these disorders. Stratifying by race, sex, and diagnoses, multivariate analyses showed that the women with PTSD had a greater likelihood to report physical abuse (p = 0.03) and sexual abuse histories (p = 0.008) than did the women without PTSD. The men with substance-induced mood disorder (p = 0.01) were more likely to report physical abuse compared with the men without substance-induced mood disorder. Screening for abuse in patients with depressive disorders and PTSD is warranted to tailor individualized treatments for these patients. More research is needed to better understand the potential implications of childhood abuse on psychiatric diagnoses.",

Parental involvement and communication are potential protective factors to target with prevention efforts, but veterans' parenting has not been studied in general, nonclinical populations. Objectives: This study presents data on parenting characteristics among fathers who are veterans of the U.S. military and the substance use behaviors of their adolescent children. Methods: Data were analyzed from approximately 2,200 veteran fathers, 13,100 nonveteran fathers, and their children aged 12 to 17 who participated in the National Survey on Drug Use and Health from 2004 to 2013. Parenting characteristics and adolescent substance use were compared by fathers' veteran status. Results: Compared with nonveteran fathers, veteran fathers were less likely to have talked with their children about the dangers of substance use, were more likely to believe that their children used substances, and were just as likely to be parentally involved. Higher percentages of adolescent children of veterans than those of nonveterans engaged in tobacco use and nonmedical use of psychotherapeutic drugs. Parental involvement and father-child communication about the dangers of substance use did not explain differences in substance use among adolescents with veteran versus nonveteran fathers. Conclusions/Importance: Adolescent children of veterans appear to be a group in particular need of substance use prevention services. Parental involvement and father-child communication may be appropriate protective factors to address in prevention efforts.",

In this study, a questionnaire method was used for data collection. To this end, a scale was first developed to assess the effectiveness of teamwork. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: The study was conducted in 34 departments/divisions within the GMMF Training Hospital with 423 health workers. \"Specialist opinion\" was used to determine the content validity of the \"Teamwork Effectiveness Scale\" developed for this study, while \"factor analysis\" was used to test the scale's construct validity. Cronbach Alpha values were calculated to test the reliability of the scale. To determine the effect of socio-cultural characteristics on the effectiveness of teamwork, the \"Kruskal-Wallis\" test, the \"Mann-Whitney U\" test and \"Logistic Regression Analysis\" were used within the context of the study. Based on the study results, it was observed that \"assignment, \"age\" and \"status\" did not have an effect on the effectiveness of teamwork (p > 0.05). On the other hand, a significant and negative relationship was observed between \"the obligation to perform compulsory service\" and the attitudes that considered teamwork to be effective (p = 0.029). Similarly, a difference was identified between the workers' attitudes towards the effectiveness of teamwork depending on the size of the place of assignment (p = 0,042). It was thus observed that the \"effectiveness of teamwork\" was affected by the presence or absence of the \"obligation to perform compulsory service\" and by the \"size of the place of assignment.",

Postdeployment reunification also poses challenges; disruptions that have occurred must often be repaired in the context of heightened emotions on the part of each family member at a time when fathers are themselves readjusting to the routines and responsibilities of family life. The current study employed qualitative research with the central aim of informing a richer understanding of these experiences. Interviews were conducted with 14 military fathers of young children who had experienced separation from their families during deployment. Narratives were coded using principles of grounded theory, and common parenting themes were extracted. Fathers shared their hopes that their young children would develop qualities of strength, confidence, and self-sufficiency. They also discussed difficulty in supporting the development of these qualities in their young children due to problems dealing with the negative emotions and difficult behaviors that their children exhibited. Reliance on their parenting partner was commonly cited as an effective strategy as fathers transitioned back to family life. Implications for intervention programs include the provision of parenting and self-care skills and inclusion of the father's parenting partner in the intervention. (English)",

We found developmental coherence in maternal interactive behavior, and in the relations between maternal emotional availability and children's functioning in middle childhood. Mothers and children were observed at home and in a laboratory playroom in infancy to assess maternal interactive behavior and child attachment security. When children were 7 years of age, dyads were observed in the lab; maternal emotional availability was coded using the Emotional Availability Scales, and children's disorganized and controlling attachment behavior was assessed. Classroom teachers reported on children's behavior problems; at age 8, children reported on their depressive symptoms. Results showed that aspects of maternal emotional availability (sensitivity, nonhostility, nonintrusiveness [passive/withdrawn behavior]) were associated with children's functioning in middle childhood: (a) controlling and disorganized attachment behavior, (b) behavior problems in school, and (c) self-reported depressive symptoms. Maternal emotional availability in childhood was predicted by early mother\u2013infant relationship dysfunction (maternal hostility, disrupted communication, and infant attachment insecurity).",

An integral component, although far less studied, are the ties between mental health and military spouses. Military deployments place considerable stress on military families. This study analyzed the mental health utilization of military spouses of active duty service members assigned to an aircraft carrier between 2011 and 2014. A negative binomial generalized estimating equation was used to examine the rate of change in mental health utilization over time against various deployment phases. Associations emerged between select deployment phases (i.e., deployment 1, between deployments, deployment 2) with increases in mental health utilization ranging between 12% and 20% for military spouses. This study demonstrated, for military spouses, the in between deployment phase has associations with mental health utilization rates similar to actual deployed periods. As a result, military leaders should continue to monitor the well-being of their service members' families throughout all deployment phases.",

One area of interest concerns the possible benefits that on-site child care could have for improving veterans\u2019 access to VA mental health care. Child care programs are currently being piloted at the VA for the first time, although the need for them has not been evaluated. We conducted a brief survey of a convenience sample of 147 veterans (132 men, 15 women) seeking mental health care at outpatient clinics and/or at a psychiatric rehabilitation center at one VA. Participants were asked about their attitudes and experiences regarding child care and parenting support at the VA. Of the 52 (35.4%) participants who responded and had children under 18, the majority of both men and women surveyed agreed that the VA should offer child care services and that they would use child care services at the VA if it were available. These results are based on a small sample of participants, but they may contribute to ongoing discussion and efforts to develop \u201cfamily-friendly\u201d mental health services.",

While there has been an increase in research and intervention focused on the effects on families of military deployments, much of this work has not focused specifically on the particular needs of young children. Talk, Listen, Connect: Multiple Deployments (TLC-II MD), a multimedia kit designed for home use, is among the first interventions directed toward young children. Created by Sesame Workshop and using popular Sesame Street characters, TLC-II MD was designed to support and equip families with young children with skills to address challenges associated with multiple deployments. This study utilized a randomized experimental design to evaluate the impact of TLC-II MD relative to a control condition using a Sesame Workshop multimedia kit not tailored to military families. Parents in both groups reported that children enjoyed the video overall and watched it repeatedly. Also in both groups, caregivers' depressive symptoms and children's aggressive behaviors declined significantly over time. Caregivers in the test group reported significantly larger increases in comfort discussing the deployment with their child and stronger perceptions that the DVD helped children to cope. Thus, the resilience-oriented materials were helpful to both groups, but those tailored to military families were significantly more likely to be perceived as helpful. Findings offer evidence regarding the ability of multimedia self-administered interventions to assist military families.",

This report outlines the development of Dance for Veterans over the past several years within the VA Greater Los Angeles Healthcare System, including curricular rationale, training model and program evaluation. Methods: Participation was voluntary and required only a mental illness diagnosis. Survey data and qualitative feedback (N = 88), as well as verbal reports of stress (N = 35), were collected over 3-month periods to assess effects of the class on veterans\u2019 well-being. Results: Verbal reports of stress before and after class showed significant decreases (p < 0.001), and subjective responses to the classes were overwhelmingly positive. Significant longer-term trends in stress reduction, however, were not demonstrable. Conclusions: The Dance for Veterans program shows promise as an interdisciplinary resource for veterans diagnosed with serious mental illness. Future program development will include more detailed evaluation of its effects on veterans\u2019 well-being and extension to additional VA venues and populations.",

        "paperAbstract": "Background: Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) is associated with reduced depressive symptoms, quality of life improvements, behavioral activation, and increased acceptance among veterans. This study was conducted to increase the reach and impact of a veterans' MBSR program by identifying barriers to enrollment and participation to inform modifications in program delivery.Objective: Verify or challenge suspected barriers, and identify previously unrecognized barriers, to enrollment and participation in MBSR among veterans.Design: A retrospective qualitative analysis of semistructured interviews.Setting/location: VA Puget Sound Health Care System (Seattle, WA).Subjects: 68 interviewed, and 48 coded and analyzed before reaching saturation.Approach: Content analysis of semistructured interviews.Results: Of the participants who enrolled, most (78%) completed the program and described MBSR positively. Veterans identified insufficient or inaccurate information, scheduling issues, and an aversion to groups as barriers to enrollment. Participants who discontinued the program cited logistics (e.g., scheduling and medical issues), negative reactions to instructors or group members, difficulty understanding the MBSR practice purposes, and struggling to find time for the practices as barriers to completion. Other challenges (cohort dynamics, teacher impact on group structure and focus, instructor lack of military service, and physical and psychological challenges) did not impede participation; we interpreted these as growth-facilitating challenges. Common conditions among veterans (chronic pain, posttraumatic stress disorder, and depression) were not described as barriers to enrollment or completion.Conclusions: Women-only MBSR groups and tele-health MBSR groups could improve accessibility to MBSR for veterans by addressing barriers such as commute anxiety, time restrictions, and an aversion to mixed gender groups among women. Educating MBSR teachers about veteran culture and health challenges faced by veterans, adding psychoeducation materials that relate mindfulness practice to conditions common among veterans, and improving visual aids for mindful movement exercises in the workbook could better accommodate veterans who participate in MBSR.",

While there is considerable literature evidencing that higher levels of mindfulness are associated with decreased stress and anxiety in civilian cross-sectional studies, fewer studies have examined this relationship utilizing longitudinal designs with recently deployed National Guard soldiers. The present study examined the resilience-promoting effects of mindfulness on symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), anxiety, and general distress with members of Aviation (N = 52) and Infantry (N = 146) battalions of the Army National Guard who recently returned from deployment. Each study participant completed measures at two time points (3 and 12 months post-deployment) to examine whether mindfulness predicted symptom reporting over time. Overall, findings suggest that time 1 mindfulness is a significant predictor of time 2 general distress, anxiety, and the hyperarousal symptom cluster, but not time 2 total PTSD. Consistent with previous studies, these findings suggest that mindfulness measures may be useful for identifying soldiers at risk and resilient for post-deployment psychological distress. The implications for different diagnostic frameworks and criteria are considered.",

We sought to replicate these findings with a demographically similar sample and to determine whether the findings could be attributed the high-risk nature of the sample by assessing the impact of violence exposure on sex differences. Methods A cross-sectional sample of 2577 youth (ages 11\u201318, M=15.4, SD=1.9, 52% female, 25% Caucasian) collected in 2004 from a high-risk community reported on history of dating and exposure to multiple forms of violence. We conducted moderation analyses to test whether polyvictimization (PV) and age moderated the potential sex differences in perpetration and victimization of sexual TDV and injury. Results No significant sex differences in victimization were observed regardless of degree of PV. Boys reported more frequent sexual TDV and injury perpetration relative to girls, but only for youth reporting high degree of PV. There were no sex differences in perpetration among low PV youth. Conclusions These findings suggest boys from high-risk communities may disproportionately perpetrate severe acts of TDV but at this early age they are equally likely to be victimized. To interrupt the cycle of violence victimization and perpetration, comprehensive violence prevention interventions targeting high-risk youth should be implemented at schools, in homes, and in the community; and they should recognize the potential for girls and boys to be victims of even the most severe forms of TDV.",

Methods: Claims data for children enrolled in the Department of Defense TRICARE Dental Program for the period of February 1, 2010 through January 31,2011 were used to identify children who had a dental visit during that benefit year. Results: Of the 376,681 continuously enrolled children, 266,862 (71%) had at least one dental visit during the benefit year. 82.7% of children of officers had a dental visit, as compared to 66.4% of children from enlisted families. There was a difference in dental utilization based on the military rank of the sponsors (X\u00b2 = 8,939.39, df = 1, p < 0.0001). Children of officers were 2.5 times (95% confidence intervals = 2.44-2.61), and children of warrant officers were 1.6 times (95% confidence intervals = 1.51-1.74) more likely to have a dental visit than children from enlisted families. The results also show utilization trends within the enlisted and officer categories with higher utilization among more senior personnel. Conclusions: Socioeconomic status does play a role in dental care-seeking behavior of military families. Even when families voluntarily enroll in a program and there are no cost shares for services such as preventive services, there may be other barriers to accessing care that need to be addressed so that all groups can maximize their oral health.",

Participants were 175 males in PTSD residential treatment who were assessed at pre-treatment, post-treatment, and at 4-month follow-up. Post-treatment PTSD severity predicted aggression at post-treatment and 4-month follow-up, adjusting for age, pre-treatment PTSD severity, and pre-treatment aggression. When examining the relation between aggression and specific PTSD symptom clusters, post-treatment Reexperiencing, Avoidance/Numbing and Hyperarousal symptoms predicted aggression at posttreatment and 4-month follow-up. These results support the hypothesis that post-treatment PTSD severity may be an important marker of post-treatment aggression risk and may offer unique information important to clinicians and patients focused on the development and maintenance of adaptive, non-aggressive relationships after intensive PTSD treatment.",

However, studies assessing the health concerns related to partner violence victimization tend to focus on women, and none have assessed the health of male physical partner violence victims who sought help for their victimization. Purpose To understand men\u2019s mental and physical health concerns that may be related to partner violence victimization. Methods In 2012\u20132013, two samples of men\u2014611 physical partner violence victims who sought help and 1,601 men from a population-based sample\u2014completed online questionnaires on their demographics, various types of partner violence victimization, physical health, mental health, and other risks. Data were analyzed using logistic regression, log binomial models, and robust Poisson models in 2013. Results In comparison to the population-based sample of men, male partner violence victims who sought help had significantly poorer health, particularly with regard to post-traumatic stress disorder, depression, high blood pressure, sexually transmitted diseases, and asthma. These differences remained after controlling for sample differences in demographics, substance use, previous traumatic exposure, and social support. Conclusions Practitioners should assess for health problems among partner violence victims and for partner violence victimization among men presenting with health problems.",

This study uses data from the Survey of Income and Program Participation to examine how household work-limiting disability status moderates the relationship between veteran status and the likelihood of material hardship. Results suggest the following: nondisabled-veteran households report lower or equivalent levels of material hardship than do households with no veteran or disabled member; regardless of whether a veteran is present, households that include a disabled person have higher levels of every type of hardship than other households do; and disabled-veteran households experience statistically significantly more hardship than nondisabled-veteran households do.",

        "paperAbstract": "Background Youth mental health is a significant public health concern due to the high prevalence of mental health problems in this population and the low rate of those affected seeking help. While it is increasingly recognized that prevention is better than cure, most youth prevention programs have utilized interventions based on clinical treatments (eg, cognitive behavioral therapy) with inconsistent results. Objective This study explores the feasibility of the online delivery of a youth positive psychology program, Bite Back, to improve the well-being and mental health outcomes of Australian youth. Further aims were to examine rates of adherence and attrition, and to investigate the program\u2019s acceptability. Methods Participants (N=235) aged 12-18 years were randomly assigned to either of two conditions: Bite Back (n=120) or control websites (n=115). The Bite Back website comprised interactive exercises and information across a variety of positive psychology domains; the control condition was assigned to neutral entertainment-based websites that contained no psychology information. Participants in both groups were instructed to use their allocated website for 6 consecutive weeks. Participants were assessed pre- and postintervention on the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale-Short form (DASS-21) and the Short Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Well-Being Scale (SWEMWBS). Results Of the 235 randomized participants, 154 (65.5%) completed baseline and post measures after 6 weeks. Completers and dropouts were equivalent in demographics, the SWEMWBS, and the depression and anxiety subscales of the DASS-21, but dropouts reported significantly higher levels of stress than completers. There were no differences between the Bite Back and control conditions at baseline on demographic variables, DASS-21, or SWEMWBS scores. Qualitative data indicated that 49 of 61 Bite Back users (79%) reported positive experiences using the website and 55 (89%) agreed they would continue to use it after study completion. Compared to the control condition, participants in the Bite Back condition with high levels of adherence (usage of the website for 30 minutes or more per week) reported significant decreases in depression and stress and improvements in well-being. Bite Back users who visited the site more frequently (\u22653 times per week) reported significant decreases in depression and anxiety and improvements in well-being. No significant improvements were found among Bite Back users who demonstrated low levels of adherence or who used the website less frequently. Conclusions Results suggest that using an online positive psychology program can decrease symptoms of psychopathology and increase well-being in young people, especially for those who use the website for 30 minutes or longer per week or more frequently (\u22653 times per week). Acceptability of the Bite Back website was high. These findings are encouraging and suggest that the online delivery of positive psychology programs may be an alternate way to address mental health issues and improve youth well-being nationally.

        "paperAbstract": "Purpose: Since 2001, many military families have experienced multiple and extended deployments. Little is known about the effect of parental deployment on the well-being of children, and few, if any, studies to date have engaged school staff to understand whether and how parental deployments affect the behavioral, social, and emotional outcomes of youth in the school setting. Methods: Focus groups and semi-structured interviews were conducted with teachers, counselors, and administrative staff at schools serving children from U.S. Army families (N = 148 staff). Participants were queried about the academic, behavioral, and emotional issues faced by children of deployed soldiers. Data were analyzed for themes in these areas, with attention to differences by service component (Active Component vs. Army Reserve and National Guard). Results: Although some children seem to be coping well with deployment, school staff felt that children's anxiety related to parental absence, increased responsibilities at home, poor mental health of some nondeployed parents, and difficulty accessing mental health services affected the ability of other students to function well in school. Conclusions: School staff felt that parental deployment negatively affected social and emotional functioning for some children and youth, although they felt others were coping well. Future research should examine factors related to youth outcomes during parental deployment (e.g., mental health of the non-deployed parent) and assess the effects of deployment on other measures of behavior such as school engagement and academic performance.",

Methods\u00a0This is an observational study using Veterans Affairs (VA) administrative and clinical databases of OEF-OIF Veterans who had enrolled in and used VA care. The prevalence of back problems, musculoskeletal conditions, and joint disorders was determined at years 1 through 7 after deployment for female and male Veterans using ICD-9 code groupings for these conditions. Results\u00a0Female Veterans were younger (mean age 29 vs. 30, P<0.0001), more likely to be African American (26% vs. 13%, P<0.0001), and less likely to be married (34% vs. 47%, P<0.0001). For both female and male Veterans, the prevalence of painful musculoskeletal conditions increased each year after deployment. After adjustment for significant demographic differences, women were more likely than men to have back problems [year 1 odds ratio (OR) 1.06 (1.01, 1.11)], musculoskeletal problems [year 1 OR 1.32 (1.24, 1.40)], and joint problems [year 1 OR 1.36 (1.21, 1.53)] and the odds of having these conditions increased each year for women compared with men in years 1 to 7 after deployment. Discussion\u00a0To provide quality care to female Veterans, the VA must understand the impact of deployment on women's health. Our findings provide an important picture of the increasing prevalence of musculoskeletal conditions in the female Veteran population and highlight the importance of the VA targeting treatment programs that focus on issues of particular importance to women with musculoskeletal pain.",

In both samples, path analyses revealed that, when examined simultaneously, partners\u2019 perceptions of withdrawal/numbing symptoms were associated with greater distress, but perceptions of reexperiencing symptoms were unrelated to psychological distress and significantly associated with lower levels of relationship distress. Given the cross-sectional nature of the data in both samples, there are multiple plausible interpretations of the results. However, the pattern is consistent with an attributional model of partner distress, whereby partners are less distressed when symptoms are more overtly related to an uncontrollable mental illness.

This prospective longitudinal study investigated whether repeated and intentional harm doing by peers (peer victimization) in childhood predicts internalizing symptoms in early adolescence. 3,692 children from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC), as well as their mothers and teachers, reported on bullying in childhood (7\u201310 years) and internalizing problems in early adolescence (11\u201314 years). Controlling for prior psychopathology, family adversity, gender and IQ, being a victim of bullying was associated with higher overall scores, as well as increased odds of scoring in the severe range (>90th percentile) for emotional and depression symptoms. Victims were also more likely to show persistent depression symptoms over a 2-year period. These associations were found independent of whether mothers, teachers or the children reported on bullying. It is concluded that peer victimization in childhood is a precursor of both short-lived and persistent internalizing symptoms, underlining the importance of environmental factors such as peer relationships in the etiology of internalizing problems.",

        "paperAbstract": "Recent models on parenting propose different roles for fathers and mothers in the development of child anxiety. Specifically, it is suggested that fathers' challenging parenting behavior, in which the child is playfully encouraged to push her limits, buffers against child anxiety. In this longitudinal study, we explored whether the effect of challenging parenting on children's social anxiety differed between fathers and mothers. Fathers and mothers from 94 families were separately observed with their two children (44 % girls), aged 2 and 4 years at Time 1, in three structured situations involving one puzzle task and two games. Overinvolved and challenging parenting behavior were coded. Child social anxiety was measured by observing the child's response to a stranger at Time 1, and half a year later at Time 2, and by parental ratings. In line with predictions, father's challenging parenting behavior predicted less subsequent observed social anxiety of the 4-year-old child. Mothers' challenging behavior, however, predicted more observed social anxiety of the 4-year-old. Parents' overinvolvement at Time 1 did not predict change in observed social anxiety of the 4-year-old child. For the 2-year-old child, maternal and paternal parenting behavior did not predict subsequent social anxiety, but early social anxiety marginally did. Parent-rated social anxiety was predicted by previous parental ratings of social anxiety, and not by parenting behavior. Challenging parenting behavior appears to have favorable effects on observed 4-year-old's social anxiety when displayed by the father. Challenging parenting behavior emerges as an important focus for future research and interventions.",

        "paperAbstract": "Peer victimization is a well-known national and international problem, contributing to a range of emotional, social, and behavioral consequences. Using structural equation modeling, the authors tested a theoretical model suggesting that psychological distress and student engagement mediate the association between the experience of victimization and concurrent academic achievement. Participants were 469 (46.4 % male, 53.6 % female) 6th to 8th grade students, from randomly selected classrooms in 11 middle schools in a southeastern school district. Structural equation models of the hypothesized effects demonstrated adequate fit to the data, with both symptoms of psychological distress and engagement mediating the relationship between victimization and academic achievement. In general, the results suggest that victimization predicts diminished academic achievement by way of psychological distress and poorer engagement in classroom and academic tasks. However, the direct relationship between victimization and measures of achievement lacked significance across many correlational and path analyses conducted. These findings have implications for researchers and practitioners in understanding how psychological distress and student engagement are associated with the academic performance of students who experience peer victimization.",

The experiences of parents, partners, and siblings of Iraq and Afghanistan War veterans were explored, to understand the consequences of repeated deployments on participants\u2019 mental health. Method. Purposive sampling was used. Respondents completed preliminary electronic surveys and participated in one of three focus groups. Results. High levels of relationship and psychological distress exist. Reactions and coping with deployment were split along gender lines, with females reporting anxiety and males reporting avoidance or anger. Veterans returned with significant emotional demands. The need for social and emotional support was identified. Conclusion. Similar to the experiences of spouses of veterans, extended family members are negatively impacted during deployment and reintegration. They are struggling to cope and lack the necessary skills to do so. Attempts at help seeking are unsuccessful. Recommendations include training for clinicians, school counselors and physicians to address the needs of this population, and also development of support groups for families of veterans and the veterans themselves.",

        "paperAbstract": "Nearly 40 000 service members returning from Iraq and Afghanistan have suffered traumatic injuries, with over 300 000 at risk for post\u2010traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) or other psychiatric problems. These veterans face numerous post\u2010deployment health concerns, sharing substantial burdens with their families. Although many rely upon community\u2010based health care, little is known about how these individuals present at family medicine clinics for perceived medical and psychological issues. We surveyed 347 patients during visits at six clinics, and respondents reported whether they,a family member or a close acquaintance had been deployed since 2001. Patients identified traumatic military experiences, plus any attributable health or social problems. The mean patient age was 47.5 years, with 71% women and 55% Hispanic individuals. Nearly one\u2010quarter reported family members serving overseas while 52% knew someone deployed. Significant events included nearby explosion (21%) or combat injury (9%), along with a variety of other incidents. Among the half of individuals perceiving significant health or social ramifications, the most prevalent consequences were PTSD, depression and alcohol abuse. Divorce or marital problems were noted by13%, while many reported employment, legal or other difficulties. This study offers insights into post\u2010deployment needs of military personnel and subsequent problems reported by family members. A high prevalence of traumatic combat events translated into serious health needs, plus social disruptions for veterans and their loved ones. As the long\u2010term problems disclosed by returning service personnel continue to ripple across community clinics and other health systems, effective treatment planning mandates coordinated attention from multiple providers and service organisations.",

Their deleterious effects on children and adolescents have been well documented. However, important questions remain regarding whether the type of violence exposure, the experience of one or both forms, the chronicity of violent experiences, and the age, gender, and SES of the child, differentially influence developmental outcomes. Data on 2810 children from the Project on Human Development in Chicago Neighborhoods were analyzed. Children aged 3\u20139 at the outset were assessed three times, at 3-year intervals. Primary caregivers reported on IPV, PCPA, and children\u2019s externalizing and internalizing symptoms. Children\u2019s externalizing and internalizing symptoms were examined as a function of time, age, gender, socioeconomic status (SES), and the time-varying effects of cumulative IPV and PCPA exposure. Cumulative experiences of IPV and PCPA each adversely affected the developmental trajectories of both externalizing and internalizing symptoms, but in different ways; and they did so independently of participants\u2019 age, gender, or SES, which all functioned as significant, independent predictors of child outcomes. PCPA was by far the more potent of the two forms of violence; and when both forms occurred, they worked additively to affect outcomes. Important questions remain regarding the reasons for the differential potency of these two forms of family violence on childhood symptoms, and related implications for interventions, as well as for later adult behavior.",

Similar to civilian mothers, they feel more responsible for maintaining the household and taking care of their needs, both physically and emotionally, compared to their husbands. They also often engage in what Sharon Hays (1996) described as intensive mothering, in which parents use the majority of their resources and focus much of their time to improve their children\u2019s lives. However, military motherwork is also unique in that mothers raise their children within the military institution and must adapt to deployment and all of the risks associated with combat.

This study is important because it addresses the topics of heavy drinking and family functioning in an at-risk population\u2014NG service members returning from a combat zone deployment. We surveyed NG service members (1,143) and their partners (674) 45\u201390 days after returning from a military deployment. Service member rates of hazardous drinking were 29.2% and spouses/partners 10.7%. Of the 661 linked couples, 26.2% were discrepant where only one member met the criteria for hazardous drinking and 5.4% were congruent for alcohol misuse where both members met hazardous drinking criteria. Service members belonging to either congruent or discrepant drinking groups were more distressed in their marriages/relationships than those in the nonhazardous group. In dyadic analyses, an unexpected partner effect was found for parenting outcomes; that is, when service members drink more, their spouses/partners are less stressed when it comes to parenting. Importantly, both service member and spouse/partner depression was significantly associated with negative family outcomes. Results from this study suggest that when working with these families, it is important to understand the drinking status of both soldier and spouse and to treat depression in addition to alcohol misuse.

        "paperAbstract": "The authors hypothesized that a social and emotional learning (SEL) program involving mindfulness and caring for others, designed for elementary school students, would enhance cognitive control, reduce stress, promote well-being and prosociality, and produce positive school outcomes. To test this hypothesis, 4 classes of combined 4th and 5th graders (N = 99) were randomly assigned to receive the SEL with mindfulness program versus a regular social responsibility program. Measures assessed executive functions (EFs), stress physiology via salivary cortisol, well-being (self-reports), prosociality and peer acceptance (peer reports), and math grades. Relative to children in the social responsibility program, children who received the SEL program with mindfulness (a) improved more in their cognitive control and stress physiology; (b) reported greater empathy, perspective-taking, emotional control, optimism, school self-concept, and mindfulness, (c) showed greater decreases in self-reported symptoms of depression and peer-rated aggression, (d) were rated by peers as more prosocial, and (e) increased in peer acceptance (or sociometric popularity). The results of this investigation suggest the promise of this SEL intervention and address a lacuna in the scientific literature\u2014identifying strategies not only to ameliorate children's problems but also to cultivate their well-being and thriving. Directions for future research are discussed.",

While research with veterans and their spouses has documented the particular strain of this reintegration period on veterans and their partners, little research to date has examined veterans\u2019 experiences living with their parents. The present study sought to fill this research gap by investigating veterans\u2019 experiences living with their parents using qualitative, in-depth interviews with Iraq and Afghanistan veterans in California. Overall, veterans appreciated the instrumental and emotional support their parents provided when they separated. However, in some cases, living with parents also produced conflict and strain. In situations where adult veteran children had difficulty with the transition to civilian life or returned with mental health problems, parents were often the first to identify these problems and to support their children in accessing appropriate care. We analyze these findings in light of family systems theory, identifying ways in which adult veteran children continue a process of differentiation while living with their parents and maintaining emotional connectedness. We suggest ways that clinicians can better support veterans and their parents through the reintegration period and recommend that programming for military families explicitly include parents of service members in addition to conjugal families.",

The research arose from concerns raised by practitioners working with military families, who had noted a rise in DVA. This paper examines the findings from a pilot project designed to ascertain the nature, extent and impact of DVA on military families. It begins by considering the research literature that currently exists before examining the findings of the research on which this paper is based. Whilst this research did not find high levels of formal self-reported DVA, it did find high levels of anxiety and concern amongst the partners of military personnel about the impact of family reintegration on all areas of family life. This research highlights the need to use much broader approaches that address areas of control and decision making within families in order to identify potential risk of DVA. In particular, confusion about gendered roles when military personnel are reintegrating was an issue for the partners of military personnel.",

Results indicated that mothers spanked more than fathers. When examining fathers only, fathers\u2019 spanking was not associated with subsequent child aggression. When examining both parents concurrently, only mothers\u2019 spanking was predictive of subsequent child aggression.

Existing estimates of the proportion of the US population maltreated during childhood are based on retrospective self-reports. Records of officially confirmed maltreatment have been used to produce annual rather than cumulative counts of maltreated individuals.\nObjective: To estimate the proportion of US children with a report of maltreatment (abuse or neglect) that was indicated or substantiated by Child Protective Services (referred to as confirmed maltreatment) by 18 years of age.\nDesign, Setting, and Participants: The National Child Abuse and Neglect Data System (NCANDS) Child File includes information on all US children with a confirmed report of maltreatment, totaling 5,689,900 children (2004-2011). We developed synthetic cohort life tables to estimate the cumulative prevalence of confirmed childhood maltreatment by 18 years of age.\nMain Outcomes and Measures: The cumulative prevalence of confirmed child maltreatment by race/ethnicity, sex, and year.\nResults: At 2011 rates, 12.5% (95% CI, 12.5%-12.6%) of US children will experience a confirmed case of maltreatment by 18 years of age. Girls have a higher cumulative prevalence (13.0% [95% CI, 12.9%-13.0%]) than boys (12.0% [12.0%-12.1%]). Black (20.9% [95% CI, 20.8%-21.1%]), Native American (14.5% [14.2%-14.9%]), and Hispanic (13.0% [12.9%-13.1%]) children have higher prevalences than white (10.7% [10.6%-10.8%]) or Asian/Pacific Islander (3.8% [3.7%-3.8%]) children. The risk for maltreatment is highest in the first few years of life; 2.1% (95% CI, 2.1%-2.1%) of children have confirmed maltreatment by 1 year of age, and 5.8% (5.8%-5.9%), by 5 years of age. Estimates from 2011 were consistent with those from 2004 through 2010.\nConclusions and Relevance: Annual rates of confirmed child maltreatment dramatically understate the cumulative number of children confirmed to be maltreated during childhood. Our findings indicate that maltreatment will be confirmed for 1 in 8 US children by 18 years of age, far greater than the 1 in 100 children whose maltreatment is confirmed annually. For black children, the cumulative prevalence is 1 in 5; for Native American children, 1 in 7.",

        "paperAbstract": "Parents of children with developmental delays (DD) often report significantly heightened levels of stress when compared to families of typically developing (TD) children. While elevated levels of early parenting stress are shown to negatively impact social development in TD children, this effect may be compounded for children with DD, who are already at greater risk of experiencing social difficulties. We sought to examine whether changes in child social skills occur after parent participation in mindfulness based stress reduction (MBSR) intervention, and whether these changes were associated with parent-child relational factors. Parental stress was reduced through an 8-week MBSR training group. Changes in child social skills were measured using the social skills improvement system (SSIS), which was completed by 3 categories of respondents: parents participating in the study, a secondary informant, and the child's teacher. Parent-child relational factors were measured using the parenting relationship questionnaire (PRQ). Data from 24 families of children with DD (ages 2.5-5) was examined in this study. Paired samples t-tests examining pre-post differences revealed that mothers, secondary informants, and teachers acknowledged improvements in child self-control. Mothers and teachers also reported improvements in empathy and engagement, while secondary informants and teachers reported improvements in child assertion. Teachers also reported improvements in children's communication, responsibility, and cooperation. Variance in child self-control was significantly accounted for by changes in two parent-child relational factors: attachment and discipline practices. These results suggest that addressing parental mental health may enhance the efficacy of child-focused interventions by promoting parental consistency in discipline and perceived attachment (i.e. parent-child closeness).",

Deployment to conflict and war zones is a difficult experience for both soldiers and their families. On return from deployment, all soldiers face the challenge of reintegration into family life and society, but those from the National Guard and Reserve units face the additional challenge of reintegration in relative isolation from other soldiers. There is limited research about the reintegration experiences of women and the functioning of the families during reintegration following deployment. Objective\u00a0The goal was to document postdeployment family reintegration experiences of women in the National Guard. Methods\u00a0Semistructured interviews were conducted with 42 female members of Midwestern National Guard units. Directed content analysis was used to identify categories of experiences related to women\u2019s family reintegration. Results\u00a0Five categories of postdeployment experience for female soldiers and their families were identified: Life Is More Complex, Loss of Military Role, Deployment Changes You, Reestablishing Partner Connections, and Being Mom Again. Discussion\u00a0The categories reflected individual and family issues, and both need to be considered when soldiers and their families seek care. Additional research is needed to fully understand the specific impact of gender on women\u2019s reintegration.",

Physical injuries received during combat are associated with increased symptom report [8]. The effect of a concurrent mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) on this relationship is unknown and forms the basis for this report. Subjects included a cohort of 274 male service members who received a blast-related mTBI during deployment in Iraq. They completed symptom ratings on the Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Checklist-Civilian version (PCL-C) and Neurobehavioral Symptom Inventory (NSI). Service members with mTBI, but no other associated physical injuries had higher symptom ratings than those who received mTBI plus associated injuries. Results suggest that in the presence of an invisible injury, such as mTBI, associated bodily injuries may be at least partially protective against the development of stress and neurobehavioral symptoms. It is proposed that an invisible wound, such as mTBI, creates ambiguity regarding the etiology of symptoms and expected course of recovery and leads to increased emotional and somatic symptom report. However, the observable nature of an associated physical injury and the systematic rehabilitation involved in recovery from such an injury provide a focus for attention and measurable progress toward recovery that serve to reduce emotionally-based symptom reports.",

A cross-sectional design using state-level correlations was employed. Seven outcome measures from the national 1999 Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance Survey were used. For females and males, social capital was significantly associated with five of the seven outcome measures ( all associations p < .01). For females, the amount of variance explained by these correlations ranged from 23% to 45%; the range for males was 20% to 52%. Poverty was not a significant predictor of any outcome variable. Income inequality was a significant predictor of birth control usage among females, but in multivariate regression analyses, only social capital retained significance. Findings provide preliminary evidence that social capital may have a profound influence of adolescents' sexual risk and protective behaviors. Social capital was inversely correlated with sexual risk behaviors and positively correlated with protective sexual behaviors. Further and more comprehensive research involving social capital and adolescents is warranted.",

We conducted 50 qualitative interviews and 1,337 survey interviews with home caregivers who experienced at least one deployment. The structured qualitative interview focused on caregiver experiences during deployment. The quantitative data centered on caregiver well-being and household and relationship hassles. The qualitative interview notes were the unit of analysis and traditional methods were used to analyze the data. The quantitative data were analyzed using regression models. The qualitative data revealed key deployment-related household challenges that caregivers experience and the effect of those challenges on caregivers. Multivariate analyses of the quantitative data explored differences in caregivers\u2019 emotional well-being, household and relationship hassles. The results showed important component and deployment experience differences. Caregivers affiliated with the National Guard and those with more months of deployment reported significantly poorer emotional well-being, and more household and relationship hassles. Given the important role that maternal well-being has on child and family functioning, it is critical to understand how the stress of deployment is affecting mothers in their daily routines, especially during potentially high stress periods.",

        "paperAbstract": "Objective Extensive comorbidity between depression and anxiety has driven research to identify unique and shared risk factors. This study prospectively examined the specificity of three interpersonal stressors (emotional abuse, emotional neglect, and relationally-oriented peer victimization) as predictors of depressive versus anxiety symptoms in a racially-diverse community sample of adolescents. We expanded on past research by examining hopelessness as a mediator of the relationships between these interpersonal stressors and symptoms. Method Participants included 225 adolescents (55% African-American; 59% female; Mean age = 12.84 years) who completed measures at baseline (Time 1) and two follow-up assessments (Times 2 and 3). Symptoms of depression and anxiety (social, physical, total) were assessed at Time 1 and Time 3, while intervening emotional maltreatment, peer victimization, and hopelessness were assessed at Time 2. Results Hierarchical linear regressions indicated that emotional abuse was a nonspecific predictor of increases in both depressive symptoms and symptoms of social, physical, and total anxiety, whereas relationally-oriented peer victimization predicted depressive symptoms specifically. Emotional neglect did not predict increases in depressive or anxiety symptoms. In addition, hopelessness mediated the relationships between emotional abuse and increases in symptoms of depression and social anxiety. Conclusions These findings suggest that emotional abuse and relationally-oriented peer victimization are interpersonal stressors that are relevant to the development of internalizing symptoms in adolescence, and that hopelessness may be one mechanism through which emotional abuse contributes to an increased risk of depression and social anxiety.",

Participants included 128 mother-child pairs. Mothers and children participated in two observational tasks, clean-up and Tickle-Me-Elmo, which were coded for expressions of emotion, and mothers completed self-report surveys. A person-centered latent profile analysis was applied, identifying distinct maternal profiles defined by observed positive emotion expression and reported positive and negative emotionality, depressive symptoms, and parenting stress. Four profiles were identified, labeled Happy, Melancholic, Stressed, and Struggling. These profiles were found to be associated with child outcomes, including observed positive and negative emotion expression and problem behaviors. Specifically, the Melancholic and Struggling profiles tended to be negatively related to child emotion expression, while the Stressed and Struggling profiles tended to be related to greater child problem behaviors. The results highlight meaningful distinctions between concurrent, interacting maternal characteristics that contribute to child emotion socialization, and they suggest significant differentiations in the factors that contribute to child risk.",

Does the American public support such a policy choice? Are Americans more or less supportive of defense and military spending than they were prior to September 11, 2001? This article reviews academic, independent, and media polls to address these questions. We find that contemporary levels of support for defense and military spending remain above \"normal levels\" between 1960 and 2000. We also find that although Americans are still opposed to cutting defense and military spending, they are more likely to support such cuts as a solution to the federal budget deficit after 2007.",

Less is known about symptoms in children of veterans with partial PTSD.ObjectiveTo compare mental health problems, family functioning and parent\u2013child bonding among adolescent offspring of male veterans with no PTSD, partial PTSD and full PTSD, and to examine the relationship between adolescent mental health problems and family factors.MethodsConsecutive outpatient adolescent offspring (12\u201318 years) of Croatian male veterans with no PTSD, partial PTSD and full PTSD matched for age, sex, educational level, family income, parental employment, nationality, and residential area reported on emotional and behavioral problems, family functioning and parent\u2013child bonding.ResultsThe full PTSD group reported higher levels of total behavior problems, family functioning problems and parental control than the partial PTSD group, which in turn, reported higher levels than the no PTSD group. The partial and full PTSD groups reported comparable levels of emotional and behavioral problems, and parental care. The partial and no PTSD groups did not differ on maternal care, which was significantly higher in these groups than in the full PTSD group. Higher levels of emotional and behavioral symptoms were associated with lower levels of maternal care in the partial PTSD group.",

Specifically, the objective was to investigate which variables (coping strategies and perception of social support available) might better predict different stress outcomes in the four groups. Parents were asked to fill in three questionnaires: Parent Stress Index, Coping Orientation to Problems Experienced and Social Support Questionnaire. Significant differences among groups in all of the variables considered were found. These results suggest the advisability of fostering functional coping strategies and social support received in families of children with disabilities, and especially in those with children with low functioning autism.",

Many speculate that one mechanism of this association may be decreased disclosure by veterans, but previous studies lacked appropriate data to test this hypothesis. In a sample of 224 OIF/OEF-era National Guard service members (SMs) and 214 of their romantic partners, we measured SMs\u2019 PTSD symptoms. Four to six months later, we assessed both partners\u2019 reports of SMs\u2019 emotional disclosure and both partners\u2019 relationship satisfaction (83 SMs and 91 partners completed Time 2). In a path analysis, SMs\u2019 emotional numbing was negatively associated with their later relationship satisfaction. Furthermore, SMs\u2019 emotional numbing was negatively associated with both partners\u2019 reports of SMs\u2019 emotional disclosure. Finally, SMs\u2019 emotional numbing exerted significant or nearly significant indirect effects on both partners\u2019 relationship satisfaction via decreased emotional disclosure. The findings demonstrated the importance of accounting for both partners\u2019 perceptions when studying couple functioning in the context of PTSD or treating PTSD via conjoint intervention.",

The current qualitative study was designed to better understand barriers to mental health treatment experienced by adolescents in military families. Focus groups and individual interviews were conducted with military adolescents (n = 13), military (non-enlisted) parents (n = 12), and mental health service providers who treat adolescents in military families (n = 20). Discussions primarily explored barriers to seeking treatment, with supplemental questions assessing the ideal elements of mental health services for this population. Seven barriers to engaging in mental health services were identified: four internal (confidentiality concerns, stigma, ethic of self-reliance, lack of perceived relevance) and three external (time and effort concerns, logistical concerns, financial concerns). Challenges engaging military adolescents in mental health services are discussed and several recommendations are offered for service providers attempting to work with this population.",

        "paperAbstract": "One of the constants of the military lifestyle is geographic mobility, or permanent change of station (PCS). The PCS has a particularly profound effect on military children with disabilities and their families. With each PCS, families choreograph an elaborate dance with losing and gaining schools and providers as they navigate the complexities of a new special education system. In this study, more than 100 individuals, enrollees of a military program for families with dependents with disabilities and providers serving them, participated in focus groups and interviews to identify the challenges that families face and the resources that are available to them. Drawing on relevant research literature and the results of the study, the authors explore some of the common challenges military students with disabilities and their families face and offer resources and recommendations for school staff supporting them. School staff can take steps to assist and support these families, such as proactively planning for the PCS with the families, informing families about ways in which current services may be different from what they have previously experienced or will experience, and joining in the children's circle of support as an ally and a trusted source of information.",

Connections between loss salience, identity construal, and balance of identity construal on grief intensity via their association with post-loss identity disruption were examined across three types of self-relevant losses; death of a family member, job loss, or divorce. We hypothesized that lower salience, higher endorsement of identity attributes represented by relational and individualistic self-construals, and an overall balance across identity attributes would be related to decreased grief severity across all types of loss. Results supported hypotheses with the exception that the hypothesized ameliorative effect of increases in relational self-construal was only seen in the bereaved group.",

In addition, we examined the additive and interactive contributions of CSR, PTSD and attachment dimensions to parenting measures. The sample consisted of 477 participants divided into two groups: a clinical group of veterans who had been diagnosed with CSR on the battlefield (N = 267), and a matched control group of veterans who did not suffer from CSR (NCSR; N = 210). CSR, PTSD, avoidant-attachment, and anxious-attachment, were all related to lower levels of parental functioning and satisfaction. Veterans who suffered from both CSR and PTSD reported more concern for their offspring during their child's military service compared to veterans with PTSD but without antecedent CSR. Attachment dimensions and specifically attachment-avoidance, made the greatest contribution to parenting measures, followed by posttraumatic symptoms. In addition, attachment-avoidance moderated the relationship between posttraumatic symptoms and parental functioning. Theoretical and clinical implications of these results are discussed.

Methods: A national, stratified sample of Iraq-Afghanistan combat veterans receiving VA medical care responded to a mailed survey focused on community reintegration. Of 1,226 veterans surveyed, 754 (62%) responded. Prevalence and proportions were adjusted for potential nonresponse bias. Results: An estimated 25% to 56% of combat veterans who use VA services reported 'some' to 'extreme' difficulty in social functioning, productivity, community involvement, and self-care domains. At least one-third reported divorce, dangerous driving, increased substance use, and increased anger control problems since deployment. Almost all (96%) expressed interest in services to help readjust to civilian life (95% confidence interval [CI] = 93%\u201399%). The most commonly preferred ways to receive reintegration services or information were at a VA facility, through the mail, and over the Internet. An estimated 41% (95% CI = 36%\u201346%) screened positive for PTSD, and probable PTSD was associated with reporting more readjustment difficulties and expressing interest in more types of services, including traditional mental health services. Conclusions: Iraq-Afghanistan combat veterans who already receive VA medical care reported multiple current reintegration problems and wanted services and information to help them readjust to community life. These concerns were particularly prevalent among those with probable PTSD. Research is needed to explore nontraditional modes of service delivery, including the Internet.",

On average, ASP experiences negatively predicted externalizing problems and positively predicted social self-control and assertion. Interestingly, positive ASP experiences did not predict decreased externalizing behaviors, but instead children with negative experiences had higher levels of externalizing behavior problems. Changes in ASP experiences positively predicted changes in self-control scores, but only for boys.

The purpose of this cross-sectional study was to assess mental health symptoms, utilization of mental health services, and perceived barriers to service use among National Guard members and their significant others (including spouses and others with whom they share a committed relationship) from a Midwestern state.\nMethods: Participants were recruited for the study at military-sponsored reintegration workshops, which took place 45-90 days after service members' return from deployment. A sample of 332 National Guard members and 212 significant others volunteered to complete a survey that assessed mental health symptoms, service utilization, and barriers to treatment.\nResults: Forty percent of National Guard members and 34% of significant others met the screening criteria for one or more mental health problems. Of those meeting the criteria, 53% reported seeking help of some kind (50% of soldiers; 61% of significant others). Stigma associated with mental health care and concerns about service utilization appearing on military records ranked high as barriers among service members. Concerns about the influence of mental health issues on career advancement were of note. For significant others, barriers included the costs of mental health care, trouble with scheduling appointments, difficulty in getting time off work, and not knowing where to get help.\nConclusions: The mental health effects of combat on the soldier and his or her significant other remain a challenge for National Guard families, who often reside in communities that show little understanding of the psychological costs of war. Barriers remain for mental health service utilization.",

The current study examined secondary trauma (ST) and generalized distress symptoms (general psychiatric symptomatology, functional disability, and self-rated health) in wives of former prisoners of war (ex-POWs). The study compared wives of Israeli ex-POWs from the 1973 Yom Kippur War with wives of a matched control group of non-POW Yom Kippur War combat veterans (CVs). The wives also were divided into groups based on their husbands\u2019 current posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) status and PTSD trajectory (i.e., chronic, delayed), and their outcomes were compared with resilient CVs. We found that wives of ex-POWs with PTSD reported higher ST and generalized distress than wives of ex-POWs and non-POW CVs without PTSD. Wives of ex-POWs with chronic PTSD reported the highest levels of functional disability. We also found that the relationships between husbands\u2019 prior captivity, and wives\u2019 ST and general psychiatric symptomatology were fully mediated by the husbands\u2019 PTSD symptoms. These findings indicate that it is exposure to a partner with PTSD that leads to overall ST and other distress symptoms, and not simply to a trauma survivor. Furthermore, the more severe their husbands\u2019 PTSD, the more wives are at risk for ST and general psychiatric symptomatology. Wives of partners with PTSD should therefore be considered high-risk groups for ST and distress that may require targeted interventions.",

Methods: We analyzed anonymous, self-administered predeployment surveys from 2543 National Guard members deployed to Iraq in 2008. We used bivariate and multivariate analyses to measure the effects of prior service in Afghanistan (Operation Enduring Freedom [OEF]) or Iraq (Operation Iraqi Freedom [OIF]) on mental and physical health. Results: Nearly 25% of respondents reported at least 1 previous OEF or OIF deployment. Previously deployed soldiers were more than 3 times as likely as soldiers with no previous deployments to screen positive for posttraumatic stress disorder (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 3.69; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 2.59, 5.24) and major depression (AOR = 3.07; 95% CI = 1.81, 5.19), more than twice as likely to report chronic pain (AOR = 2.20; 95% CI = 1.78, 2.72) and more than 90% more likely to score below the general population norm on physical functioning (AOR = 1.94; 95% CI = 1.51, 2.48). Conclusions: Repeated OEF and OIF deployments may adversely affect the military readiness of New Jersey National Guard combat soldiers.",

The sample consisted of 361 adoption-linked families, each including an adopted child, adoptive parents, and a birth mother. Heightened social wariness in children at age 18 months predicted reduced levels of observed structured parenting (i.e., less directive parenting with fewer commands and requests) in adoptive mothers at age 27 months. Adoptive fathers' lower structured parenting at age 18 months predicted subsequent elevation in child social wariness. Birth mothers' history of fear-related anxiety disorders was not associated with child social wariness.

To fully understand the human cost of war, the psychosocial impact of separation and homecoming of military personnel on their families must also be considered. Recent arduous conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan make understanding the impact of war on spouses topical and pertinent. Widespread psychological morbidity and social dysfunction have been reported in spouses of military personnel who have been deployed to combat zones such as Vietnam, with difficulties most acute for spouses of military personnel with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). A review of the literature published between 2001 and 2010 assessing the impact of deployments to Iraq and Afghanistan on spouses of military personnel was conducted. A total of 14 US-based studies were identified which examined psychological morbidity, help seeking, marital dysfunction and stress in spouses. Longer deployments, deployment extensions and PTSD in military personnel were found to be associated with psychological problems for the spouse. Methodological differences in the studies limit direct comparisons. Recommendations for future research are outlined. The needs of spouses of military personnel remain an important issue with implications for service provision and occupational capability of both partners.",

Studies show that mental health symptoms mediate the association between most deployment stressors and suicidal ideation; however, family-related factors during deployment are largely unexplored. We examined posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and depression symptoms as mediators of the associations between deployment family support and stress and post-deployment suicidal ideation in combat-exposed OEF/OIF veterans. Design: National cross-sectional mail survey. Methods: 1046 veterans responded to the survey. The sample for this study was 978 veterans who experienced combat. Regression-based path analyses were conducted. Results: Family support and stress had direct associations with suicidal ideation. When PTSD and depression symptoms were examined as mediators of these associations, results revealed significant indirect paths through these symptoms. Conclusions: This study contributes to the literature on suicidal ideation risk factors among OEF/OIF veterans. Deployment family support and family stress are associated with suicidal ideation; however these associations occur primarily through mental health symptomatology, consistent with findings observed for other deployment factors. This research supports ongoing efforts to treat mental health symptomatology as a means of suicide prevention.",

The effects on children's school achievement of nonconventional family organization, parents' values and commitment to their family life-style, and family stability were examined in a 12-year longitudinal study of 146 nonconventional families and a comparison group of 43 stable, two-parent conventional families. In spite of considerable instability and other potential risk conditions in nonconventional families' lives (single parent or unmarried couple status, frequent change, stigma, low incomes, and others), most of their children do as well or better in school than a comparison group of conventional families. These effects were still present after adjusting for child WISC-R, gender, and family SES. Those children doing best in school come from families who have a stronger commitment to their nonconventional family life-style while those doing less well have families with a lower commitment. Children in single parent families bad grades similar to those of children in two-parent families. Family stability-regardless of the form of the family (single parent or couple)-also was associated with higher grades. Strong commitment to meaningful values regarding the importance of one's family life-style can protect children against some of the risks that were a part of many countercultural family's lives.",

Therefore, our goal is to study physical health functioning in OEF/OIF veterans after deployment.\nMethods: We analyzed self-reported physical health functioning as physical component summary (PCS) scores on the Veterans version of the Short Form 36 health survey in 679 OEF/OIF veterans clinically evaluated at a post-deployment health clinic. Veterans were stratified into four groups based on time post-deployment: (1Yr) 0 - 365 days; (2Yr) 366 - 730 days; (3Yr) 731 - 1095 days; and (4Yr+) > 1095 days. To assess the possibility that our effect was specific to a treatment-seeking sample, we also analyzed PCS scores from a separate military community sample of 768 OEF/OIF veterans evaluated pre-deployment and up to one-year post-deployment.\nResults: In veterans evaluated at our clinic, we observed significantly lower PCS scores as time post-deployment increased (p = 0.018) after adjusting for probable post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). We similarly observed in our community sample that PCS scores were lower both immediately after and one year after return from deployment (p < 0.001) relative to pre-deployment PCS. Further, PCS scores obtained 1-year post-deployment were significantly lower than scores obtained immediately post-deployment (p = 0.02).\nConclusion: In our clinical sample, the longer the duration between return from deployment and their visit to our clinic, the worse the Veteran's physical health even after adjusting for PTSD. Additionally, a decline is also present in a military community sample of OEF/OIF veterans. These data suggest that, as time since deployment length increases, physical health may deteriorate for some veterans.",

Objective: To test whether psychiatric symptoms are associated with family reintegration problems in recently returned military veterans. Design: Cross-sectional survey of a clinical population. Respondents who were referred to behavioral health evaluation from April 2006 through August 2007 were considered for the survey. Setting: Philadelphia Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Pa. Participants: 199 military veterans who served in Iraq or Afghanistan after 2001 and were referred for behavioral health evaluation from primary care (mean age = 32.7 years, SD = 9.1). Main Outcome Measures: Measures included the Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview for psychiatric diagnoses, the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire for depression diagnosis and severity, and screening measures of alcohol abuse and illicit substance use. A measure of military family readjustment problems and a screening measure of domestic abuse were developed for this study. Results: Three fourths of the married/cohabiting veterans reported some type of family problem in the past week, such as feeling like a guest in their household (40.7%), reporting their children acting afraid or not being warm toward them (25.0%), or being unsure about their family role (37.2%). Among veterans with current or recently separated partners, 53.7% reported conflicts involving 'shouting, pushing, or shoving,' and 27.6% reported that this partner was 'afraid of them.' Depression and posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms were both associated with higher rates of family reintegration problems. Conclusions: Mental health problems may complicate veterans' readjustment and reintegration into family life. The findings suggest an opportunity to improve the treatment of psychiatric disorders by addressing family problems. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)",

        "paperAbstract": "Identifying environmental risk factors in the pathway to depression is an important research goal. To extend prior research, designs that rule out alternative explanatory factors; genetic effects and reverse causation, and permit tests of both parent and child gender are required. The present study used two different samples to address these issues. A longitudinal community sample of 316 families (157 boys, 159 girls) aged 11-12 years (mean 11.7) at Time 1 and 12-13 years at Time 2 (mean 12.7) was used to test the direction of effects between parent hostility and child and adolescent depression symptoms. A genetically sensitive sample of 1,075 twin pairs; 653 dizygotic (135 male, 183 female, 335 opposite sex) and 422 monozygotic (180 male and 242 female) aged 12-20 years (mean 16.12) was used to test whether parent hostility had environmental effects. Analyses were conducted separately by parent and child gender. Using cross-lagged panel analyses, the association between mother-daughter hostility and depression symptoms was found to be longitudinal and bidirectional with reciprocal effects between mothers and daughters. Behavioural genetic analyses in the twin sample revealed a significant environmental link between mother hostility and symptoms of daughter depression independent of genetic factors. A significant pathway was found between daughter depressive symptoms and father hostility but not vice versa. This association was accounted for by genetic factors in behavioural genetic analyses. Findings provide evidence of an environmental risk pathway to depression symptoms and identify patterns of variation according to parent and child gender. Results are discussed in relation to underlying explanatory processes and clinical implications.",

        "paperAbstract": "Due to the current prolonged conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan, members of the United States National Guard and Reserve have shifted from a historically support-based role to an integral segment of combat efforts. Clinical and epidemiological research studies conducted on both civilian and military populations have documented high rates of comorbidity of stress disorders and substance use disorders. It is widely understood that excessive alcohol use is an issue among military personnel. The aim of this paper is to describe risk factors for alcohol-related serious consequences in a study of Army National Guard service members, as well as the role of resilience in protecting against these risks. Members of the National Guard (N=320) participated in the survey. We conducted a multiple regression to predict alcohol-related serious consequences and a simple moderation analysis was performed. After controlling for race, education, and deployment history, several variables emerged as significant predictors of alcohol-related consequences. Higher stressors, lower resilience, younger age, being unmarried and not living as married, being male, and identifying as non-Hispanic were associated with higher levels of serious alcohol-related consequences. Results revealed that resilience significantly moderated the relationship between stress and alcohol-related consequences. This study furthers our understanding of the alcohol-stress relationship by contextualizing it in terms of behaviors related to alcohol, as opposed to measuring consumption only. Most importantly, our work extends prior research in its examination of resilience as a moderator of the relationship between stress and serious alcohol-related consequences.",

Among other variables, students were asked about their PA and self-efficacy for participating in PA. Results: Based upon a series of multilevel analyses, self-efficacy was found to be a significantly stronger correlate of PA for girls. But, boys had significantly higher self-efficacy compared with girls, which resulted in significantly more PA. Conclusions: Findings suggest self-efficacy is an important correlate of PA among adolescent girls but that boys are more physically active because they have more self-efficacy for PA.",

Permission to contact military partners was sought from a sample of Australian Defence Force (ADF) members. Partners provided data on deployment history, physical health, mental health, and their children's emotions, and behaviors. Associations between multiple deployments and health and well-being of partners and children were assessed using logistic regression. Data were collected from 1,332 Australian Defence Force partners (response rate 36%) with 1,095 children aged between 4 and 17 years. Almost half (47%) of partners had experienced more than one deployment, mainly to Timor-Leste, Iraq, and Afghanistan. There was little evidence of associations between numbers of deployments and the health of the partner. In contrast, more behavioral problems were reported for children who experienced two or more deployments with odds ratios generally greater than 2 and significant trends with increasing numbers of deployment. Although military families who experience multiple deployments may, by selection, be more resilient than those who have fewer deployments, these results suggest that adverse impacts on the children may accrue with increasing parental absences because of deployment.",

        "paperAbstract": "Objective: Empirically based couple therapy results in significant improvements in relationship satisfaction for the average couple; however, further research is needed to identify mediators that lead to change and to ensure that improvements in mediators predict subsequent\u2014not just concurrent\u2014relationship satisfaction. In addition, given that much of the current literature on couple therapy examines outcomes in a research environment, it is important to examine mediators in a treatment-as-usual setting. Method: To address these questions, 161 heterosexual couples (322 individuals) received treatment-as-usual couple therapy at one of two Veteran Administration Medical Centers (M = 5.0 and 13.0 sessions at the two sites) and were assessed before every session. The majority of couples were married (85%) and had been together for a median of 7.8 years (SD = 13). Participants were primarily White, non-Hispanic (69%), African American (21%), and White, Hispanic/Latino (8%). Results: Individuals\u2019 own self-reported improvements in communication, emotional closeness, and psychological distress (but not frequency of behaviors targeted in treatment) mediated the effect of treatment on their subsequent relationship satisfaction. When all significant mediators were examined simultaneously, improvements in men\u2019s and women\u2019s emotional closeness and men\u2019s psychological distress independently mediated subsequent relationship satisfaction. In contrast, improvements in earlier relationship satisfaction mediated the effect of treatment only on subsequent psychological distress. Conclusion: This study identifies unique mediators of treatment effects and shows that gains in mechanisms predict subsequent relationship satisfaction. Future investigations should focus on the role of emotional closeness and psychological distress\u2014constructs that have often been neglected\u2014in couple therapy.

However, CSA has been understudied in military samples. The purpose of the present study was to examine the relative contributions of CSA and combat exposure to PTSD and marital satisfaction. Two hundred eighteen National Guard/Reserve veterans who deployed overseas between 2001 and 2008 completed self-report measures of CSA, marital satisfaction, combat exposure, and PTSD symptom severity. Data were analyzed using linear regression and path analysis to evaluate a comprehensive model including all variables. CSA accounted for unique variance in PTSD symptom severity independent of combat exposure. CSA also had a negative direct association with marital satisfaction, independent of combat exposure and PTSD symptom severity. In contrast, combat exposure had only a negative indirect association with marital satisfaction via PTSD when all variables were examined simultaneously. CSA accounted for unique variance in both PTSD symptom severity and marital satisfaction in this sample of combat veterans. Clinically, results suggest that assessment and treatment of CSA is indicated for military veterans suffering from PTSD. Further, treatment of CSA may improve marital satisfaction, which may positively affect psychological functioning in the veteran.",

Many (44%) reported unaddressed mental health needs. Barriers included inability to attend daytime appointments (38%), inability to find a counselor who understands the needs of military spouses (35%), inability to find a counselor the participant could trust (29%), concerns about confidentiality (26%), and lack of knowledge about where to get services (25%). The barriers reported differed markedly from those described by distressed women in the general population. Conclusions: Military wives are an underserved population.

At the initial assessment and 1 year later, fathers reported on their involvement in play and caregiving activities with the focal child, and coparenting behavior was observed during triadic family interactions. Structural equation modeling was used to test cross-lagged associations between coparenting behavior and father involvement. Overall, paths from father involvement to coparenting behavior were significant, but paths from coparenting behavior to father involvement were not. Specifically, greater father involvement in play was associated with an increase in supportive and a decrease in undermining coparenting behavior over time. In contrast, greater father involvement in caregiving was associated with a decrease in supportive and an increase in undermining coparenting behavior. Multigroup analysis further showed that these cross-lagged relations did not differ for dual-earner families and single-earner (father) families, but these relations appeared to differ for families with focal daughters and families with focal sons. These findings highlight the potential for fathering to affect coparenting and the importance of the role of contextual factors in coparenting-fathering relations.

This research was conducted as part of an ongoing multisite longitudinal investigation. The participants were 388 children (198 boys, 190 girls). Peer victimization was assessed with a peer nomination inventory that was administered when the average age of the participants was approximately 8.5 years. Internalizing problems were assessed using a behavior problem checklist completed by mothers in 9 consecutive years, and a structured clinical interview was administered to the participants in the summer following high school graduation (10\u201311 years after the victimization assessment). Peer victimization in middle childhood was correlated with internalizing problems on a bivariate basis through the late years of adolescence. Multilevel analyses also revealed associations between peer victimization and increases in internalizing problems over time. In addition, peer victimization had a modest link to unipolar depressive disorders in late adolescence. Victimization in the peer group during middle childhood appears to be a marker of long-term risk for internalizing behavior problems and unipolar depression.",

This risk may be heightened in National Guard and Reserve (NG/R) families who tend to be isolated from other NG/R families and do not benefit from the centralized support system available to active duty families living on military bases. Isolation and trauma-related disorders may complicate the adjustment of military families during reintegration. An evidence-based parent training intervention was modified to meet the unique needs of recently deployed NG/R parents and their spouses, and the modified program was evaluated in a randomized controlled trial. The current study examines engagement and satisfaction with the program. Modifications such as employment of military-connected facilitators sought to maximize engagement in and satisfaction with the program. Engagement and satisfaction were examined between mothers and fathers, as well as between groups led by a military-connected facilitator and those led by civilian facilitators. Significantly greater engagement was noted for groups that were led by a military-connected facilitator (p = .01). There were no differences between genders in attendance rates, though greater positive group experiences were reported by mothers versus fathers (p = .01).

Furthermore, social\u2013emotional competence is a key component of young children's school readiness. This study reports the results of a randomized trial of a parent engagement intervention (Getting Ready) designed to facilitate school readiness among disadvantaged preschool children, with a particular focus on social\u2013emotional outcomes. Two hundred and twenty children were involved over the 4-year study period. Statistically significant differences were observed between treatment and control participants in the rate of change over a 2-year period on teacher reports for certain interpersonal competencies (i.e., attachment, initiative, and anxiety/withdrawal). In contrast, no statistically significant differences between groups over a 2-year period were noted for behavioral concerns (anger/aggression, self-control, or behavioral problems) as a function of the Getting Ready intervention. Practice or Policy: The intervention appears to be particularly effective at building social\u2013emotional competencies beyond the effects experienced as a function of participation in Head Start programming alone. Limitations and implications for future research are reviewed.",

Reconnecting the family, renegotiating roles that have shifted, reestablishing communication patterns, and dealing with mental health concerns are all tasks that spouses must undertake as part of reintegration. We tested telephone support groups focusing on helping spouses with these basic reintegration tasks. Year-long telephone support groups focused on education, skills building (communication skills, problem solving training, cognitive behavioral techniques, stress management), and support. Spouse depression and anxiety were decreased and perceived social support was increased during the course of the study. In subgroup analyses, spouses with husbands whose injuries caused care difficulties had a positive response to the intervention. However, they were more likely to be depressed, be anxious, and have less social support compared to participants who had husbands who had no injury or whose injury did not cause care difficulty. Study findings suggest that this well-established, high-access intervention can help improve quality of life for military spouses who are struggling with reintegration of the service member and family.",

The purpose of this study was to describe the psychosocial profile of school age children during parental deployment utilizing standardized psychosocial health and stress measures, and to identify predictors of children at \u201chigh risk\u201d for psychosocial morbidity during wartime deployment. Methods:\u00a0Army spouses with a deployed service member and a child aged 5\u201312 years completed a deployment packet consisting of demographic and psychosocial questions. The psychosocial health measures included the Pediatric Symptom Checklist (PSC), the Parenting Stress Index-Short Form and the Perceived Stress Scale-4. Results:\u00a0Overall, 32% of respondents exceeded the PSC cut off score for their child, indicating \u201chigh risk\u201d for psychosocial morbidity and 42% reported \u201chigh risk\u201d stress on the Parenting Stress Index-Short Form. Parenting stress significantly predicted an increase in child psychosocial morbidity (odds ratio 7.41, confidence interval 2.9\u201319.0, p < 0.01). Parents utilizing military support reported less child psychosocial morbidity (odds ratio 0.32, confidence interval 0.13\u20130.77, p < 0.01) and parental college education was related to a decrease in child psychosocial morbidity (odds ratio 0.33, confidence interval 0.13\u20130.81, p < 0.02). The effects of military rank, child gender, child age, and race or ethnic background did not reach statistical significance. Conclusion:\u00a0Families in this study experiencing deployment identified one-third of military children at \u201chigh risk\u201d for psychosocial morbidity. The most significant predictor of child psychosocial functioning during wartime deployment was parenting stress. Military, family and community supports help mitigate family stress during periods of deployment.",

        "paperAbstract": "Military deployment can create significant relationship strain. Although most couples navigate the challenges of deployment successfully, this period may render some couples more vulnerable to adverse relationship outcomes such as infidelity due to a convergence of factors including geographic separation and reduced emotional and physical intimacy. Despite anecdotal reports of increased rates of infidelity during deployment, empirical findings are lacking. This study used a prospective design to examine the prevalence and risk factors of infidelity across the deployment cycle including a year-long deployment to Iraq. A total of 63 married male Airmen were assessed both pre- and 6-9 months postdeployment. The rate of sexual infidelity prior to deployment (21%) was commensurate with the lifetime rate of sexual involvement outside the marriage in representative community samples of men. Across the deployment period, the prevalence of sexual infidelity was strikingly high (22.6%) compared with annual community estimates (1.5-4%; Allen et al., 2005). Findings demonstrated that service members with a prior history of separation, steps toward divorce, and relationship distress prior to deployment had elevated risk for infidelity over the deployment cycle. Moreover, roughly 75% of Airmen who experienced infidelity over the deployment cycle divorced by 6-9 months postdeployment whereas only 5% of service members without infidelity divorced during this same time period. Considering well-documented adverse impacts of infidelity and divorce, the current findings may assist in identifying military couples at risk for infidelity and informing targeted prevention or early intervention strategies for these couples prior to or immediately following deployment.

Youth also identified the specific ways that adults supported them: (a) guidance and motivation, (b) skill\u2010based support, (c) role modeling, (d) connecting, (e) emotional support, and (f) cultivating youth voice. Finally, participants reported the following outcomes related to such support: (a) social capital, (b) a sense of empowerment and control of their futures, and (c) a sense of acceptance and validation. This study is a contribution to the literature on adult\u2013youth relationships in connected learning sites and draws attention to the potential socioemotional and instructional benefits of such programs.

Adaptive disclosure (AD) is relatively brief to accommodate the busy schedules of active-duty service members while training for future deployments. Further, AD takes into account unique aspects of the phenomenology of military service in war in order to address difficulties such as moral injury and traumatic loss that may not receive adequate and explicit attention by conventional treatments that primarily address fear-inducing life-threatening experiences and sequelae. In this program development and evaluation open trial, 44 marines received AD while in garrison. It was well tolerated and, despite the brief treatment duration, promoted significant reductions in PTSD, depression, negative posttraumatic appraisals, and was also associated with increases in posttraumatic growth.",

        "paperAbstract": "Context: A growing body of literature has demonstrated the association of combat in Iraq and Afghanistan with postdeployment mental health problems, particularly posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and depression. However, studies have shown varying prevalence rates of these disorders based on different case definitions and have not assessed functional impairment, alcohol misuse, or aggressive behavior as comorbid factors occurring with PTSD and depression. Objectives: To (1) examine the prevalence rates of depression and PTSD using several case definitions including functional impairment, (2) determine the comorbidity of alcohol misuse or aggressive behaviors with depression or PTSD, and (3) compare rates between Active Component and National Guard soldiers at the 3- and 12-month time points following their deployment to Iraq. Design: Population-based, cross-sectional study. Setting: United States Army posts and National Guard armories. Participants: A total of 18 305 US Army soldiers from 4 Active Component and 2 National Guard infantry brigade combat teams. Interventions: Between 2004 and 2007, anonymous mental health surveys were collected at 3 and 12 months following deployment. Main Outcome Measures: Current PTSD, depression, functional impairment, alcohol misuse, and aggressive behavior. Results: Prevalence rates for PTSD or depression with serious functional impairment ranged between 8.5% and 14.0%, with some impairment between 23.2% and 31.1%. Alcohol misuse or aggressive behavior comorbidity was present in approximately half of the cases. Rates remained stable for the Active Component soldiers but increased across all case definitions from the 3- to 12- month time point for National Guard soldiers. Conclusions: The prevalence rates of PTSD and depression after returning from combat ranged from 9% to 31% depending on the level of functional impairment reported. The high comorbidity with alcohol misuse and aggression highlights the need for comprehensive postdeployment screening. Persistent or increased prevalence rates at 12 months compared with 3 months postdeployment illustrate the persistent effects of war zone service and provide important data to guide postdeployment care.",

Methods Data are from a sub-sample of the 2011 California Healthy Kids Survey (N=14,512). Items to assess victimization and weapon carrying were separated into three categories: physical acts (e.g., being pushed or shoved), nonphysical acts (e.g., having rumors spread about them) and weapon carrying. Results The bivariate results indicate that youth with a military-connected parent had higher rates of physical victimization (56.8%), nonphysical victimization (68.1%), and weapon carrying (14.4%) compared to those with siblings serving (55.2%, 65.2%, and 11.4%, respectively) and nonmilitary-connected (50.3%, 61.6%, and 8.9%, respectively) youth. Having a parent in the military increased the odds of weapon carrying by 29% (Odds Ratio=1.29, 95% confidence interval=1.02\u20131.65). Changing schools and a larger number of family member deployments in the past 10years were associated with significant increases in the likelihood of victimization and weapon carrying. Conclusions The results of this analysis warrant a focus on school supports for youth experiencing parental military service, multiple relocations and deployments of a family member.",

We proposed that positive affect and social support from family and friends would have indirect effects on psychological well-being through their association with a greater sense of community with the military culture. Participants were 207 female spouses of active-duty service members. Data were analyzed using MEDIATE to test the mediational effect. Results indicated that social support from friends and positive affect did predict a sense of community, which in turn was associated with increased feelings of psychological well-being.

This study investigated factors associated with employment-related outcomes (employment status, self-reported work performance, and self-reported work satisfaction) among National Guard members returning from Operation Enduring Freedom, Operation Iraqi Freedom, or Operation New Dawn deployments. Methods: The sample consisted of 1,151 National Guard service members who had returned from overseas deployments approximately six months earlier. Bivariate and multivariable analyses were performed to examine associations between predictors and employment-related outcome variables. Results: Higher-risk alcohol use was associated with reduced odds of being employed as well as with lower ratings of work satisfaction, whereas psychiatric symptom load was associated with lower self-reported work performance and work satisfaction ratings. Perceived social resources were associated with higher self-reported work performance and work satisfaction, whereas better physical functioning was associated with better self-reported work performance. Conclusions: Policy makers and clinicians may need to consider and assess alcohol use among unemployed National Guard members. They may also need to consider psychiatric symptom load and physical functioning among employed service members who perceive poor work performance and have low work satisfaction.

Earlier studies have identified specific mental health trajectories both in children and adults. This study aimed, first, to identify potential PTSS-related trajectories by using latent class growth analyses among children in a three-wave assessment after the 2008/2009 War on Gaza, Palestine. Second, it analyzed how family- and child related factors (e.g., attachment relations, posttraumatic cognitions (PTCs), guilt, and emotion regulation) associate with the trajectory class membership. Methods The sample consisted of 240 Palestinian children (49.4% girls and 50.6% boys) of 10\u201313 years of age (M=11.29, SD=0.68), who completed PTSS (CRIES) assessments at 3 (T1), 5 (T2), and 11 (T3) months after the war. Children reported their personal exposure to war trauma, attachment style, cognitive trauma processing, and emotion regulation, and their parents reported family war trauma exposure and attachment style. Results Results revealed a three-trajectory solution, a majority of children belonging to the Recovery trajectory (n=183), and a minority belonged either to Resistant trajectory (n=29) or to Increasing symptoms trajectory (n=28). Low levels of negative posttraumatic cognitive appraisals, feelings of guilt and emotion regulation were characteristic of children in the Resistant trajectory as compared to Increasing symptoms trajectory.

METHODS: The Fragile Families and Child Well-Being Study, a longitudinal birth cohort study of children in 20 medium to large US cities, was used. Parental reports of spanking were assessed at age 3 and 5, along with child externalizing behavior and receptive vocabulary at age 9 (N = 1933). The data set also included an extensive set of child and family controls (including earlier measures of the child outcomes). RESULTS: Overall, 57% of mothers and 40% of fathers engaged in spanking when children were age 3, and 52% of mothers and 33% of fathers engaged in spanking at age 5. Maternal spanking at age 5, even at low levels, was associated with higher levels of child externalizing behavior at age 9, even after an array of risks and earlier child behavior were controlled for. Father\u2019s high-frequency spanking at age 5 was associated with lower child receptive vocabulary scores at age 9. CONCLUSIONS: Spanking remains a typical rearing experience for American children. These results demonstrate negative effects of spanking on child behavioral and cognitive development in a longitudinal sample from birth through 9 years of age.",

        "paperAbstract": "How does having a sibling in the military affect young adults? Despite increasing attention to the challenges faced by spouses and children of servicemembers, the siblings of servicemembers have been largely ignored in the existing literature. This qualitative investigation uses unstructured narratives to explore siblings' perceptions of changes in their lives and changes in the family of origin associated with having a family member enlist in the United States military. Thematic analyses revealed an acute period of conflict followed by reorganization, awareness of the parents' distress, changes in the emotional climate of the family, shifts in family roles, admiration for the military sibling, and increased meaning and purpose for the family following the servicemember's enlistment. Computer-assisted text analyses revealed both positive and negative emotional expressions associated with the siblings' military service. For professional psychologists who come into contact with siblings of servicemembers, it is important to recognize that military enlistment can have ripple effects and complicate other common individual and family stresses. More generally, it is important to provide siblings and the family of origin with information about what to expect during and after the servicemember's enlistment, especially since these families may lack support from and contact with others going through similar transitions.

We use nationally representative data from interviews with caregivers of 1,726 children aged 2 to 9 years of age. We hypothesized different family dynamics predictors for a composite of common types of sibling victimization (property, psychological, and mild physical aggression) in comparison to severe physical sibling victimization (victimization that includes physical aggression with a weapon and/or injury). Multinomial regression results showed that sibling victimization in general was associated with negative family dynamics but that children in the severe group had even less parental warmth, poor parental supervision, and greater exposure to interparental conflict and family violence than children in the common types victimization group. Different aspects of family dynamics contribute to sibling victimization, but possibly in different ways and with different consequences. The findings underscore the importance of a family systems theory approach to clinical and intervention work. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved)",

One hypothesis is that differential combat and traumatic sexual experiences and attenuated levels of social support between men and women may differentially contribute to the development and perpetuation of pain. This investigation examined [1] gender differences in trauma, social support, and family conflict among veterans with chronic pain, and [2] whether trauma, social support, and family conflict were differentially associated with pain severity, pain interference, and depressive symptom severity as a function of gender. Methods: Participants included 460 veterans (56% female) who served in support of recent conflicts, and who endorsed pain lasting 3 months or longer. Participants completed a baseline survey during participation in a longitudinal investigation. Self\u2010report measures included pain severity, pain interference, depressive symptom severity, exposure to traumatic life events, emotional and tangible support, and family conflict. Results: Relative to men, women veterans reporting chronic pain evidenced higher rates of childhood interpersonal trauma (51% vs 34%; P < 0.001) and military sexual trauma (54% vs 3%; P < 0.001), along with lower levels of combat exposure (10.00 vs 16.85, P < 0.001). Gender was found to be a moderator of the association of marital status, combat exposure, childhood interpersonal trauma, and family conflict with pain interference. It also moderated family conflict in the prediction of depressive symptoms. Conclusions: Results underscore the potential importance of developing and testing gender specific models of chronic pain that consider the relative roles of trauma, social support, and family conflict.

        "paperAbstract": "Background: Military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan have involved the frequent and extended deployment of military personnel, many of whom are married. The effect of deployment on mental health in military spouses is largely unstudied. Methods: We examined electronic medical-record data for outpatient care received between 2003 and 2006 by 250,626 wives of active-duty U.S. Army soldiers. After adjustment for the sociodemographic characteristics and the mental health history of the wives, as well as the number of deployments of the personnel, we compared mental health diagnoses according to the number of months of deployment in Operation Iraqi Freedom in the Iraq\u2013Kuwait region and Operation Enduring Freedom in Afghanistan during the same period. Results: The deployment of spouses and the length of deployment were associated with mental health diagnoses. In adjusted analyses, as compared with wives of personnel who were not deployed, women whose husbands were deployed for 1 to 11 months received more diagnoses of depressive disorders (27.4 excess cases per 1000 women; 95% confidence interval [CI], 22.4 to 32.3), sleep disorders (11.6 excess cases per 1000; 95% CI, 8.3 to 14.8), anxiety (15.7 excess cases per 1000; 95% CI, 11.8 to 19.6), and acute stress reaction and adjustment disorders (12.0 excess cases per 1000; 95% CI, 8.6 to 15.4). Deployment for more than 11 months was associated with 39.3 excess cases of depressive disorders (95% CI, 33.2 to 45.4), 23.5 excess cases of sleep disorders (95% CI, 19.4 to 27.6), 18.7 excess cases of anxiety (95% CI, 13.9 to 23.5), and 16.4 excess cases of acute stress reaction and adjustment disorders (95% CI, 12.2 to 20.6). Conclusions: Prolonged deployment was associated with more mental health diagnoses among U.S. Army wives, and these findings may have relevance for prevention and treatment efforts.",

In order to provide appropriate services, research must be done to determine the needs of these families. A qualitative methodology was used to interview military spouses with children with ASD about their experiences with therapeutic services. Overall, results indicate military families with a child with ASD experience challenges associated with both the military lifestyle and having a child with special needs. Due to their membership in two groups prone to support limitations and therapeutic service accessibility issues, military families with a child with ASD may be at additional risk for high levels of stress and difficulty obtaining and maintaining ASD related services.",

Methods: We surveyed a national sample of 596 OEF/OIF veterans, oversampling women to make up 50% of the total, and National Guard and Reserve components to each make up 25%. Weights were applied to account for stratification and nonresponse bias. Results: Mental health functioning was significantly worse compared with the general population; 13.9% screened positive for probable posttraumatic stress disorder, 39% for probable alcohol abuse, and 3% for probable drug abuse. Men reported more alcohol and drug use than did women, but there were no gender differences in posttraumatic stress disorder or other mental health domains. OIF veterans reported more depression or functioning problems and alcohol and drug use than did OEF veterans. Army and Marine veterans reported worse mental and physical health than did Air Force or Navy veterans. Conclusions: Continuing identification of veterans at risk for mental health and substance use problems is important for evidence-based interventions intended to increase resilience and enhance treatment.

Our study examined the resource needs of 1,738 parents of children and adults with IDD in the state of Tennessee. Most parents reported limited familiarity with programs across every domain (e.g., residential, vocational, postsecondary). The extent to which parents indicated various types of information would be helpful varied by demographic factors (e.g., daughter or son's age, disability diagnosis, socioeconomic status), as did the avenues through which they indicated they were most likely to access information and resources.

This preliminary study examined the relationship of child distress postinjury to preinjury deployment-related family distress, injury severity, and family disruption postinjury. Child distress postinjury was assessed by reports from 41 spouses of combat-injured service members who had been hospitalized at two military tertiary care treatment centers. Families with high preinjury deployment-related family distress and high family disruption postinjury were more likely to report high child distress postinjury. Spouse-reported injury severity was unrelated to child distress. Findings suggest that early identification and intervention with combat-injured families experiencing distress and disruption may be warranted to support family and child health, regardless of injury severity.",

In this issue, Commander Gorman et al. address parental wartime deployment and the use of mental health (MH) services among military children aged 3 to 8 years. It is one of the first studies to capture data from a large number of military children representing multiple active-duty (AD) services during a period of high-intensity parental deployments. The authors should be commended for their ability to extricate important pediatric needs from a system of complex, multipurpose electronic resources. By using comprehensive claims data, they report increased outpatient visits for anxiety, behavioral, and stress disorders in 3- to 8-year-old children of deployed parents compared with nondeployed parents. More claims were filed for families in which the children were older, AD parents were married, and the deployed parent was the father. Although there was a gender and marital-status effect in this study that implied more married AD fathers had children with MH problems, there may be an ascertainment bias by those who claimed Tricare health benefits while a married AD father was deployed. It is clear that a consistent finding across developmental studies is that child distress is closely linked to parental distress. By understanding the military family and the experiences of parental wartime deployments, all pediatricians and other child-serving providers can be the 'front line' for the health and well-being of US military children, especially in times of war.",

Sensitive caregiving was measured using a modified version of the Observational Ratings of the Caregiving Environment and children's effortful control skills were assessed using both a parent questionnaire and a laboratory assessment. Results suggest that effortful control is sensitive to thresholds of caregiver sensitivity. Specifically, positive associations between caregiver sensitivity and effortful control skills a year later were observed only for children in settings with relatively high-quality caregiver sensitivity. These findings suggest that supporting the development of children's effortful control skills may require exposure to child care that exceeds typical levels of caregiving quality experienced by young children in the United States.

Of the 1.2 million school-aged children of military service members, only 86,000 actually attend schools administered by the Department of Defense on military installations throughout the world. The remaining military children attend schools administered by civilian public schools, private schools, and other civilian-run educational agencies. At present, there is a knowledge gap in educational research regarding military-connected schools and students. Given the lack of educational research on military children, the primary objective of this review is to outline findings from noneducational disciplinary empirical literatures that are of direct relevance to schooling for educational researchers who want to conduct studies on military-connected schools and students. The authors reviewed studies on military children and their families that examined links between special circumstances and stressors as well as outcomes that are known to impact students\u2019 school experiences. A synthesis of literature generated six themes: mental health in military families, child maltreatment, the impact of deployment on military children and families, the reintegration experience, war-related trauma of the returning veteran parent, and the experience of Reservist and Guard families in civilian contexts.

Using a cross-sectional design, the present study tested hypotheses regarding associations between self-reported suicide attempts, emotion regulation difficulties, and positive youth\u2013adult relationships among 7,978 high-school students (48.6 % male, 49.9 % female) in 30 high schools from predominantly rural, low-income communities. 683 students (8.6 %) reported a past-year suicide attempt. Emotion regulation difficulties and a lack of trusted adults at home and school were associated with increased risk for making a past-year suicide attempt, above and beyond the effects of depressive symptoms and demographic factors. The association between emotion regulation difficulties and suicide attempts was modestly lower among students who perceived themselves as having higher levels of trusted adults in the family, consistent with a protective effect. Having a trusted adult in the community (outside of school and family) was associated with fewer suicide attempts in models that controlled only for demographic covariates, but not when taking symptoms of depression into account. These findings point to adolescent emotion regulation and relationships with trusted adults as complementary targets for suicide prevention that merit further intervention studies. Reaching these targets in a broad population of adolescents will require new delivery systems and \u201coption rich\u201d (OR) intervention designs.",

Mindfulness-based approaches may improve adjustment among chronically stressed and disadvantaged youth by enhancing self-regulatory capacities. This paper reports findings from a pilot randomized controlled trial assessing the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary outcomes of a school-based mindfulness and yoga intervention. Four urban public schools were randomized to an intervention or wait-list control condition (n = 97 fourth and fifth graders, 60.8% female). It was hypothesized that the 12-week intervention would reduce involuntary stress responses and improve mental health outcomes and social adjustment. Stress responses, depressive symptoms, and peer relations were assessed at baseline and post-intervention. Findings suggest the intervention was attractive to students, teachers, and school administrators and that it had a positive impact on problematic responses to stress including rumination, intrusive thoughts, and emotional arousal.",

However, a unified program across the Department of Defense (DoD) that meets family needs and connects to communities is elusive. Military Family Life Project data show that participation in many programs is limited, but when the programs are used, they often work well. The data suggest the 'coercive bureaucracy' that envelopes the military extends to the family and limits motivation to utilize programs. We propose that the military employ the Self- Determination Theory to motivate families to elevate above basic survival so they can thrive. With 73% of families living outside of military installations, their participation in programs will require community involvement because the government cannot meet the needs of most families by itself. Connecting government and community programs requires a transparent unified program structure. We propose that product life-cycle management will elucidate and integrate existing programs across the entire service life cycle and enhance community connectivity.",

        "paperAbstract": "Background. The stress sensitization theory hypothesizes that individuals exposed to childhood adversity will be more vulnerable to mental disorders from proximal stressors. We aimed to test this theory with respect to risk of 30-day major depressive episode (MDE) and generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) among new US Army soldiers. Methods. The sample consisted of 30 436 new soldier recruits in the Army Study to Assess Risk and Resilience (Army STARRS). Generalized linear models were constructed, and additive interactions between childhood maltreatment pro\ufb01les and level of 12-month stressful experiences on the risk of 30-day MDE and GAD were analyzed. Results. Stress sensitization was observed in models of past 30-day MDE (\u03c782 = 17.6, p = 0.025) and GAD (\u03c782 = 26.8, p = 0.001). This sensitization only occurred at high (3+) levels of reported 12-month stressful experiences. In pairwise comparisons for the risk of 30-day MDE, the risk difference between 3+ stressful experiences and no stressful experiences was signi\ufb01cantly greater for all maltreatment pro\ufb01les relative to No Maltreatment. Similar results were found with the risk for 30-day GAD with the exception of the risk difference for Episodic Emotional and Sexual Abuse, which did not differ statistically from No Maltreatment. Conclusions. New soldiers are at an increased risk of 30-day MDE or GAD following recent stressful experiences if they were exposed to childhood maltreatment. Particularly in the military with an abundance of unique stressors, attempts to identify this population and improve stress management may be useful in the effort to reduce the risk of mental disorders.",

        "paperAbstract": "Objective: Spouse/partners of military personnel demonstrate elevated levels of distress during military deployments, yet there is insufficient information about courses of adjustment over time. The current study identified trajectories of depression and alcohol use problems and predictors of those trajectories across the deployment cycle. Method: National Guard soldiers (N = 1973) and spouses/intimate partners (N = 1020) completed assessments of risk/protective factors and baseline measures of mental health functioning 2 to 5 months prior to soldiers\u2019 1-year deployments (Time 1) to Kuwait/Iraq in support of Operation New Dawn or Afghanistan in support of Operation Enduring Freedom. Partners\u2019 mental health was reassessed at 4 months (Time 2) and 8 months (Time 3) after soldiers deployed, and both spouses/partners and soldiers were reassessed 2\u20133 months postdeployment (Time 4). Results: Latent class growth modeling of partner depression symptoms over time revealed 4 groups: Resilience (79.9%), Deployment Distress (8.9%), Anticipatory Distress (8.4%), and Post-Deployment Distress (2.7%). Three alcohol misuse trajectories were identified: Resilience (91.3%), Deployment Onset (5.4%), and Deployment Desistance (3.3%). Predeployment predictors of partners\u2019 depression symptom trajectories varied by group and included soldier reports of stressors and social support and partner levels of neuroticism, introversion, disconstraint, and reported stressors. Predeployment predictors of alcohol misuse trajectories varied by group, and included soldier levels of alcohol misuse as well as partner neuroticism, disconstraint, and family readiness. Conclusions: Delineating and predicting trajectories of partner adjustment can allow for better targeted interventions toward those most at risk for heightened distress or alcohol problems over the deployment cycle.

No prior randomized controlled trial had supported the efficacy of such an intervention in this population. Method: Participants included 69 male service members or veterans and their female partners. Recruitment was conducted from February 2010 through August 2013, and participation occurred within 2 Department of Veterans Affairs hospitals. All couples completed an initial assessment including diagnostic interviews and measures of physical and psychological IPV and were randomized by cohort to a supportive prevention couples group or Strength at Home Couples. All couples were reassessed at postintervention and at 6 and 12 months follow-ups. Results: Both service members or veterans and their female partners engaged in fewer acts of reported physical and psychological IPV in the Strength at Home Couples condition relative to supportive prevention, and relative risk of physical violence was lower for both members of the dyad in Strength at Home Couples at follow-up assessments (male service member or veteran IPV relative risk [RR] = .53; female IPV RR = .43). Those in Strength at Home Couples evidenced significantly greater program completion than did those in supportive prevention (RR = 1.73; 95% confidence interval [1.00, 2.99]). Exploratory analyses did not find differences between groups on relationship satisfaction. Conclusion: Results provide support for the efficacy of Strength at Home Couples in preventing physical IPV and reducing psychological IPV. These results have important implications for preventing violence and associated physical and mental health problems.",

METHOD. Seventy military personnel who were deployed to Iraq participated in a randomized controlled trial. Thirty-five received 3 wk (\u00b39 sessions) of sensory-enhanced hatha yoga, and 35 did not receive any form of yoga. RESULTS. Sensory-enhanced hatha yoga was effective in reducing state and trait anxiety, despite normal pretest scores. Treatment participants showed significantly greater improvement than control participants on 16 of 18 mental health and quality-of-life factors. We found positive correlations between all test measures except sensory seeking. Sensory seeking was negatively correlated with all measures except low registration, which was insignificant.

The study includes a survey developed by the researcher used in conjunction with Teacher Observation of Classroom Adaptation-Checklist to further examine the needs of these children from the perceptions of their teachers. The results of the study demonstrate that while early childhood teachers do not perceive a significant difference between military and nonmilitary dependent children in the socioemotional domains of prosocial behavior, concentration, and disruptive behavior, they do believe there is a difference related to stability. Additionally, early childhood teachers noted a negative socioemotional and academic impact related to parental separation and a negative academic impact related to geographic mobility. Teachers' responses indicated mixed beliefs about the social impact of frequent relocations.",

Adjusted complementary log\u2013log models were fit to estimate the relative risk of (a) smoking relapse among former smokers (men: n = 4,610; women: n = 1,453); (b) initiation of unhealthy alcohol use (problem drinking and/or drinking over recommended limits) among those with no known history of unhealthy alcohol use (men: n = 8,459; women: n = 4,816); and (c) relapse among those previously reporting unhealthy alcohol use (men: n = 3,487; women: n = 1,318). Men who reported experiencing sexual assault while in the military had sixfold higher risk for smoking relapse: relative risk (RR) = 6.62; 95% confidence interval (CI) [2.34, 18.73], than men who did not. Women who reported experiencing sexual assault while in the military had almost twice the risk for alcohol relapse: RR = 1.73; 95% CI [1.06, 2.83]. There were no other significant associations. These findings suggest that men and women may respond differently following sexual trauma, and support future concerted policy efforts by military leadership to prevent, detect, and intervene on sexual assault.",

Recurrent headaches are common in children and are often intensified by stressful life events. Military-dependent children are subjected to unique stressors, most significantly parental wartime deployment. No studies have evaluated the effect of deployment on somatic complaints, to include headaches. We conducted a parental, cross-sectional questionnaire-based study in patients aged 5 to 17 years who were seen in the pediatric or adolescent clinics at a regional military medical center. The overall prevalence of recurrent headaches in the preceding 12 months was 30%. Almost half reported headache worsening in frequency, severity, or duration over the previous 12 months, whether a parent was deployed or not. For children who had experienced parental deployment, younger children and females were affected more often. Younger females had the highest rates of headache worsening. This trend may indicate a more detrimental effect of parental deployment on childhood headache in certain populations.\n(Reprint & Copyright \u00a9 2013 Association of Military Surgeons of the U.S.)",

A great proportion of injured service members are mothers or fathers as well. A parent's combat injury can have a profound effect on his or her children. Methods: Appreciative inquiry, a qualitative methodology, was used alongside participant observation and document review. Results: Findings indicate that the program addressed children's needs at a number of points in time with six themes that have emerged from the data. These include, visits with the injured parent, self-expression, distraction and respite, parental engagement, normalization and empowerment. Conclusions: The findings lend support on ways an artists-in-residence program uses creative arts engagement to promote coping for children of hospitalized wounded service members and to encourage ongoing participation in the arts upon discharge.",

The National Surveys of Children\u2019s Exposure to Violence (NatSCEV) are comprised of three cross-sectional telephone surveys conducted in 2008, 2011, and 2014. Data were collected on the experiences of children aged one month to seventeen years. In each survey, interviews were conducted with youth 10\u201317 years old and with caregivers of children 0\u20139 years old. The analyses use pooled data from all three U.S. nationally-representative samples (total sample size of 13,052). Lifetime parental war-related absence or deployment was a marker for elevated childhood exposure to a wide array of victimization and adversity types. Cumulative past year exposure to multiple forms of victimization and adversity fully explained elevated trauma symptoms and delinquency in this population of children. Given the breadth of victimization and adversity risk, children with histories of parental war-related absence or deployment, as well as their families, represent important target groups for broad-based prevention and interventions to reduce exposure and ameliorate consequences when it does occur.",

Per departmental protocol, screening is offered at the initial obstetric visit, at 28 weeks of gestation, and at 6 weeks postpartum. A score of 14 or higher was considered high risk for having depression, and referral for additional evaluation was recommended. Included in our survey was an additional question that asked if the patient's spouse was currently deployed, returning from deployment, preparing to deploy, or if no deployment was planned. All data were entered into an electronic database and statistical analysis performed comparing Edinburgh Postpartum Depression Scale scores at each time period and deployment status.\nResults: A total of 3,956 surveys were complete and available for analysis. The risk of a positive screen was more than doubled compared with the control group (no deployment planned) if the spouse was deployed during the 28-32 week visit (4.3% compared with 13.1%, P=.012) or the postpartum period (8.1% compared with 16.2%, P=.006).\nConclusion: Deployment status has a measurable effect on the prevalence of elevated depression screening scores during pregnancy and in the postpartum period. These findings suggest that more intense monitoring, assessment, and treatment may be warranted for this at-risk population.\nLevel Of Evidence: II.",

The MGRSI obtained acceptable internal reliability (a \u00bc .76) and indicated that factors including honor, strength, and achievement were the most commonly reported sources of MGRS. Correlational and regression analyses revealed that legal- and trauma-related stressors 1 month prior to suicide were significantly associated with MGRSI score.

The present study evaluated the impact of DTC attendance on later mental health outcomes. Because participants are not randomly assigned to attend the DTC, propensity score weighting was used to compare DTC participants (N = 1,573) to a weighted control group of AFSMs (N = 1,570) in the same job specialties who returned from deployment during the same time period. Rates of endorsement to items on the Postdeployment Health Reassessment were examined and compared, as were rates of mental health diagnoses from AFSMs\u2019 official medical records. Key findings indicate that DTC participants reported lower levels of depressive and posttraumatic stress symptoms and lower levels of relationship conflict following return from deployment, as compared to weighted control participants. Mental health diagnostic rates were comparable for the 2 groups during the first 6 months following return from deployment. These findings suggest that participation in the DTC program had notable benefits for redeploying AFSMs and support the continued use of the program.",

Correlation statistics were analyzed to determine variable relationships. Results The AIT demonstrated reliability (Cronbach's \u03b1 .88) in measuring invincibility in this sample. Participant characteristics and demographics were examined and revealed age, sex, ethnicity, and relocation frequency differences in relationship to the teen's level of perceived invincibility. Family relocation frequency and parent ranking/rating were significant variables for a military population. A significant positive relationship was identified between aggressive, delinquent behavior and invincibility; a negative correlation was demonstrated between worry and invincibility. Discussion This study provided an opportunity to learn about unique influences related to being the teen of an active duty or retired military parent(s). Study findings indicate significant differences between military teens and national surveys in regard to risk taking and mental health indicators. Risk behaviors were found to occur at a lower frequency than the nationwide average, while depression occurred more frequently in this sample of military adolescents. Variations among teens of military parents in invincibility and worry scores provide direction for further study.",

The authors used the core \u201ccouple functioning\u201d variables included in the Couple Adaptation to Traumatic Stress Model as sensitizing concepts to guide the qualitative analysis process. Participant interviews (n = 15 couples, 30 total participants) were divided into subgroups according to high and low trauma symptom and relationship satisfaction scale scores. Five primary themes were identified in the results: communication, conflict management, roles, support/nurturance, and posttraumatic growth. Overall, highly satisfied couples and those with the lowest levels of traumatic stress symptoms reported more positive relationship functioning in the identified areas, while couples reporting higher traumatic stress symptoms and lower relationship satisfaction indicated varied or inconsistent qualitative results. Clinical and research implications for military couples also are identified.",

The role of parents\u2019 positive engagement and coercive interaction with their child, and family members\u2019 emotion regulation were tested as processes linking cascades of parent and child symptoms. A subsample of 183 families with deployed fathers and nondeployed mothers and their 4- to 13-year-old children who participated in a randomized control trial intervention (After Deployment: Adaptive Parenting Tools) were assessed at baseline prior to intervention, and at 12 and 24 months after baseline, using parent reports of their own and their child\u2019s symptoms. Parents\u2019 observed behavior during interaction with their children was coded using a multimethod approach at each assessment point. Reciprocal cascades among fathers\u2019 and mothers\u2019 PTSD symptoms, and child internalizing and externalizing symptoms, were observed. Fathers\u2019 and mothers\u2019 positive engagement during parent\u2013child interaction linked their PTSD symptoms and their child\u2019s internalizing symptoms. Fathers\u2019 and mothers\u2019 coercive behavior toward their child linked their PTSD symptoms and their child\u2019s externalizing symptoms. Each family member\u2019s capacity for emotion regulation was associated with his or her adjustment problems at baseline. Implications for intervention, and for research using longitudinal models and a family-systems perspective of co-occurrence and cascades of symptoms across family members are described.",

        "paperAbstract": "Previous research has shown that military women often experience potentially severe health outcomes following deployment. Data from the Millennium Cohort Study, a 21-year longitudinal study examining the health effects of military service, were used to examine this issue. In longitudinal analyses (2001\u20132008) carried out among US military women (n= 17,481), the authors examined positive screens for depression, anxiety, panic, and posttraumatic stress disorder in relation to deployment in support of the operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, while adjusting for relevant baseline and time-varying covariates. Women who were deployed and reported combat-related exposures had greater odds than nondeployed women of reporting symptoms of a mental health condition (odds ratio = 1.91, 95% confidence interval: 1.65, 2.20), after adjustment for demographic, military, and behavioral covariates. In addition, higher stress, problem drinking, and a history of mental illness were significantly associated with increased risk of later mental health conditions. In contrast, women in the Reserves or National Guard and those with higher education were at decreased risk of mental health conditions (all P\u2019s< 0.01). As the roles and responsibilities of women in the military expand and deployments continue, designing better prevention and recovery strategies specifically for women are critical for overall force health protection and readiness.",

Methods: Using active duty personnel serving between 2001 and 2006 (n = 678,382) and deployment information from the Contingent Tracking System, we identified individuals diagnosed with substance use disorders and major depression from TRICARE health records. We performed logistic regression analysis to assess the effect of deployment location and length on these diagnostic rates. Results: Increased odds of diagnosis with both conditions were associated with deployment to Iraq or Afghanistan compared with nondeployed personnel and with Army and Marine Corps personnel compared with Navy and Air Force personnel. Increases in the likelihood of either diagnosis with deployment length were only observed among Army personnel. Conclusions: There were increased substance use disorders and major depression across services associated with combat conditions. It would be important to assess whether the public health system has adequate resources to handle the increasing need of mental health services in this population.

More information is needed on the effectiveness of different sources of support, as well as sex differences in support. Associations between social support from two sources \u2013 the military unit and friends and family \u2013 and mental health symptoms were examined in a study of 1571 Marine recruits assessed at the beginning and end of a highly stressful 13-week training program. Military social support buffered the stressor exposure\u2013posttraumatic stress symptomatology (PTSS) relationship, whereas the relationship between stressor exposure and PTSS was highest when civilian social support was high. Further inspection of the interactions revealed that military support was most important at high levels of stressor exposure. Sex differences in the relationship between social support and symptoms were found, such that support from military peers was associated with lower levels of PTSS for men, whereas civilian support was associated with lower PTSS for women. While civilian social support was associated with lower levels of depression symptom severity in both women and men, the relationship was stronger for women.

This study assessed coping strategies used by male and female U.S. service members completing an intensely stressful mock-captivity exercise, compared strategies by sex, and assessed the relationship between coping and posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS). Two hundred service members (78% male) completed self-report surveys before and after mock captivity. Surveys assessed demographics, service characteristics, PTSS, and coping strategies used during mock captivity. Participants used seven coping strategies: denial, self-blame, religion, self-distraction, behavioral disengagement, positive reframing, and planning. Women used denial (p\u2264.05), self-blame (p\u2264.05), and positive reinterpretation (p\u2264.05) strategies more frequently than men, and they had higher PTSS levels following the exercise. Structural equation modeling showed that the relationship between sex and PTSS was fully mediated by coping strategies. The results of this study suggest that reducing the use of maladaptive coping strategies may mitigate PTSS among females. Future efforts should target improving coping during highly stressful and traumatic experiences.",

However, the long-term toll of war captivity on secondary traumatization (ST) and the parental bonding of adult children remain unknown. This study examined ST symptoms and parental bonding among adult children of former prisoners of war (ex-POWs' children) that were compared to adult children of comparable veterans (controls' children). Furthermore, we examined the mediating role of parental bonding and exposure to stress in the association between group and ST symptoms. Design: A correlative, cross-sectional study. Methods: Participants were Israeli ex-POWs' children (N = 98) and controls' children (N = 90), whose fathers fought in the 1973 Yom Kippur War. All participants completed a battery of self-reported questionnaires. Results: Ex-POWs' children reported a higher number of ST symptoms and lower levels of fathers' care, as compared to controls' children. Importantly, exposure to stress stemming from fathers' behaviors and fathers' care was found to mediate the association between research group and ST. Conclusions: Forty years after the war ended, the experience of living with ex-POWs is associated with ex-POWs' children psychological outcome.",

We discuss father involvement using three overlapping major domains of functioning: cognitive, affective, and behavioral. Additionally, we consider how types of father involvement differ vis-\u00e0-vis child age. Data were gathered via focus groups conducted with 71 fathers at 14 U.S. military installations. Descriptions of involvement were rich and varied. Involvement with children was a major concern for fathers, despite or perhaps because of the challenges of military careers. We discuss factors that help explain variations in involvement and offer insights about the conceptualization of father involvement for occupations requiring prolonged absences from home.

        "paperAbstract": "Large cohort studies suggest that most military personnel experience minimal posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms following warzone deployment, an outcome often labeled resilience. Very low symptom levels, however, may be a marker for low exposure, not resilience, which requires relatively high-magnitude or high-frequency stress exposure as a precondition. We used growth mixture modeling (GMM) to examine the longitudinal course of lifetime PTSD symptoms following combat exposure by disaggregating deployed U.S. Marines into upper, middle, and lower tertiles of combat exposure. All factor models fit the data well; Tucker-Lewis Index (TLI) and comparative fit index (CFI) values ranged from .91 to .97. Three distinct trajectories best explained the data within each tertile. The upper tertile comprised True Resilience (73.2%), New-Onset Symptoms (18.3%), and Pre-existing Symptoms (8.5%) trajectories. The middle tertile also comprised True Resilience (74.5%), New-Onset Symptoms (16.1%), and Pre-existing Symptoms (9.4%) trajectories. The lower tertile comprised Artifactual Resilience (86.3%), Pre-existing Symptoms (7.6%), and New-Onset Symptoms (6.1%) trajectories. True Resilience involved a clinically significant symptom increase followed by a return to baseline, whereas Artifactual Resilience involved consistently low symptoms. Conflating artifactual and true resilience may inaccurately create the expectation of persistently low symptoms regardless of warzone exposure.",

During the years of deployments to Iraq and Afghanistan adolescents in military families have faced uniquely stressful circumstances which may exacerbate difficulties commonly experienced during adolescence. For this study 91 middle-school adolescent\u2013parent dyads from U.S. Army families were surveyed about their perceptions of family functioning, social support, the adolescent's frequency of anger, and the adolescent's concerns. Findings indicated significant differences in parents' and adolescents' matched ratings for all variables except adolescent concerns. Adolescent\u2013parent perceptual discrepancies were greatest for families who had never experienced deployment and during or following the first deployment. The results of this study may be useful to those supporting military families as they develop strategies to help family members understand the others' perceptions and learn to communicate and solve problems despite the differences.",

Self reports of deployment related trauma, postdeployment PTSD symptoms, and experiential avoidance were collected from 184 men who were deployed to the Middle East conflicts, were partnered, and had a child between 4 and 13 years of age. Video samples of parent\u2013child and partner problem solving and conversations about deployment issues were collected, and were rated by trained observers to assess service members\u2019 positive engagement, social withdrawal, reactivity-coercion, and distress avoidance, as well as spouse and child negative affect and behavior. Service members\u2019 experiential avoidance was reliably associated with less observed positive engagement and more observed withdrawal and distress avoidance after controlling for spouse and child negative affect and behavior during ongoing interaction. Service members\u2019 experiential avoidance also diminished significant associations between service members\u2019 PTSD symptoms and their observed behavior. The results are discussed in terms of how service members\u2019 psychological acceptance promotes family resilience and adaption to the multiple contextual challenges and role transitions associated with military deployment.

Furthermore, the impact of unique military stressors, such as parental deployment and multiple relocations, on the sexual behaviors of MDY has not been assessed. In this pilot study, we estimated the prevalence of sexual behaviors among MDY, and examined the association between these behaviors and parental deployment and multiple relocations. Between June and September 2011, we recruited youth (N = 208; aged 15\u201319 years) who attended a military treatment facility in the southern United States, to complete a short, paper-based survey. We computed prevalence estimates and conducted Chi-square analyses, as well as logistic regression analyses, while adjusting for age, gender, and race/ethnicity. More than half (53.7 %) of the youth reported being sexually experienced, and many of these youth reported engaging in risky sexual behaviors. Parental deployment and multiple relocations were significantly associated only with having had sex in the past 3 months. Although with most sexual behaviors there was no significant association between parental deployment and multiple relocations, many MDY are sexually experienced and engage in risky sexual behaviors. MDY should thus be exposed to evidence-based strategies for sexually transmitted infection and pregnancy prevention, as well as provided with teen-friendly health care services and comprehensive sexual/reproductive health counseling.",

        "paperAbstract": "Purpose Geographic moves have been reported to have a negative impact on the mental health of children, but it is often difficult to separate the effect of the move from the circumstances that impelled it. Military populations may offer a way to examine this issue. Moves are common in military families, but parental employment and healthcare coverage remain constant. Methods Children of military parents with geographic moves in 2008 were compared with those without geographic moves with regard to the odds of mental health service use in\u00a02009. Results This study included 548,336 children aged 6\u201317\u00a0years, and 179,486 (25%) children moved in 2008. Children aged 6\u201311 years with a geographic move had higher odds of mental health and outpatient visits (odds ratio [OR] 1.03; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.01\u20131.06). Children aged 12\u201317 years with a geographic move had higher odds of mental outpatient visits (OR 1.04; 95% CI 1.01\u20131.07), psychiatric hospitalizations (OR 1.19; 95% CI 1.07\u20131.32), and emergency psychiatric visits (OR 1.20; 95% CI 1.07\u20131.32). Conclusion Children with a geographic move in the previous year have increased odds of mental health encounters. Among adolescents, this increase extends to psychiatric hospitalizations and emergency visits.",

Although the impact of parental PTSD and SUD on child development is well-documented, little is known about the influence of family composition on PTSD/SUD symptom severity. The present study investigated children in the home as an independent risk factor for symptom severity in a sample of treatment-seeking Veterans (N=94; 92% male) with comorbid PTSD/SUD. Twenty-seven percent of the sample had minor children (age 18 or younger) living in the home. Veterans with children in the home evidenced significantly higher PTSD symptomatology as measured by the Clinical Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS; M=82.65 vs. M=72.17; t=\u22122.18; p<.05), and reported using marijuana more frequently than Veterans without children in the home (34% vs. 13% of past 60days; t=\u22122.35, p<.05). In a multivariate model, having children in the home accounted for unique variance (\u0394R2=.07) in PTSD severity after accounting for a range of covariates; however, having children in the home did not account for unique variance in substance use. Directions for future research as well as potential clinical implications for parents seeking treatment for PTSD/SUD are discussed.",

        "paperAbstract": "In response to the needs of military families confronting the challenges of prolonged war, we developed Families OverComing Under Stress (FOCUS), a multi-session intervention for families facing multiple deployments and combat stress injuries adapted from existing evidence-based family prevention interventions (Lester et al. in Mil Med 176(1): 19-25, 2011). In an implementation of this intervention contracted by the US Navy Bureau of Medicine and Surgery (BUMED), FOCUS teams were deployed to military bases in the United States and the Pacific Rim to deliver a suite of family-centered preventive services based on the FOCUS model (Beardslee et al. in Prev Sci 12(4): 339-348, 2011). Given the number of families affected by wartime service and the changing circumstances they faced in active duty and veteran settings, it rapidly became evident that adaptations of this approach for families in other contexts were needed. We identified the core elements of FOCUS that are essential across all adaptations: (1) Family Psychological Health Check-in; (2) family-specific psychoeducation; (3) family narrative timeline; and (4) family-level resilience skills (e.g., problem solving). In this report, we describe the iterative process of adapting the intervention for different groups of families: wounded, ill, and injured warriors, families with young children, couples, and parents. We also describe the process of adopting this intervention for use in different ecological contexts to serve National Guard, Reserve and veterans, and utilization of technology-enhanced platforms to reach geographically dispersed families. We highlight the lessons learned when faced with the need to rapidly deploy interventions, adapt them to the changing, growing needs of families under real-world circumstances, and conduct rigorous evaluation procedures when long-term, randomized trial designs are not feasible to meet an emergent public health need.",

        "paperAbstract": "Combat exposure is associated with increased rates of mental health problems such as post-traumatic stress disorder, depression, and anxiety when Soldiers return home. Another important health consequence of combat exposure involves the potential for increased risk-taking propensity and unsafe behavior among returning service members. Survey responses regarding 37 different combat experiences were collected from 1252 US Army Soldiers immediately upon return home from combat deployment during Operation Iraqi Freedom. A second survey that included the Evaluation of Risks Scale (EVAR) and questions about recent risky behavior was administered to these same Soldiers 3 months after the initial post-deployment survey. Combat experiences were reduced to seven factors using principal components analysis and used to predict post-deployment risk-propensity scores. Although effect sizes were small, specific combat experiences, including greater exposure to violent combat, killing another person, and contact with high levels of human trauma, were predictive of greater risk-taking propensity after homecoming. Greater exposure to these combat experiences was also predictive of actual risk-related behaviors in the preceding month, including more frequent and greater quantities of alcohol use and increased verbal and physical aggression toward others. Exposure to violent combat, human trauma, and having direct responsibility for taking the life of another person may alter an individual\u2019s perceived threshold of invincibility and slightly increase the propensity to engage in risky behavior upon returning home after wartime deployment. Findings highlight the importance of education and counseling for returning service members to mitigate the public health consequences of elevated risk-propensity associated with combat exposure.",

        "paperAbstract": "Background Suicide is a leading cause of premature death among military service members/veterans (SM/Vs). The Interpersonal Theory of Suicide (Joiner, 2007) proposes that higher thwarted belonging, perceived burdensomeness, and acquired capability confer increased risk for suicide. However, no studies have examined the association of sexual dysfunction, a possible component of thwarted belonging and perceived burdensomeness, with suicidal ideation. The present study explored whether sexual dysfunction was associated with suicidal ideation when accounting for mental health, demographic, and military characteristics among female SM/Vs. Method Female SM/Vs (n = 710) completed an anonymous online survey assessing demographics, mental health, military characteristics, sexual dysfunction, and suicidal ideation. Results One hundred fifty-nine participants (22.39%) reported suicidal ideation during the preceding two weeks. A multivariable ordinal regression adjusted for age, marital status, probable posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), probable depression, race/ethnicity, Army service, and deployment history. Lower sexual functioning (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 0.98, 95% confidence interval[CI] = 0.95\u20130.99), probable PTSD (AOR = 2.54, 95% CI = 1.61\u20134.01), and probable depression (AOR = 5.28, 95% CI = 3.34\u20138.34) were associated with suicidal ideation. Post-hoc analyses examined the association of suicidal ideation with specific components of sexual functioning: difficulties with sexual arousal (AOR = 0.87, 95% CI = 0.79\u20130.97) and sexual satisfaction (AOR = 0.85, 95% CI = 0.75\u20130.96) were associated with suicidal ideation. Limitations Data were cross-sectional and limited to self-report. Discussion Sexual dysfunction is associated with suicidal ideation, accounting for established mental health, military, and demographic characteristics among female SM/Vs. Efforts to prevent suicidal ideation in female SM/Vs may be enhanced by screening for and treating sexual dysfunction, particularly sexual arousal and satisfaction.",

Anecdotally, some couples report their relationship is stronger after the deployment and others report the onset of marital problems. In a sample of 194 soldiers, we examined the association between combat exposure, mental health symptoms, aggressive behaviors, and intent to divorce or separate during the 4- and 9- month post-deployment period. At Time 1, 37% soldiers reported problems in their marriage and the degree of marital distress was positively associated with PTSD symptoms, depressive symptoms, and aggression. Time 2 intent to divorce or separate was bivariately associated with Time 1 marital distress, relationship psychological aggression, and PTSD re-experiencing symptoms; there were also trends for combat exposure and general aggression to be bivariately associated with Time 2 intent to divorce or separate. Further, there was a significant interaction between marital distress and combat exposure such that military personnel with a combination of high levels of combat exposure and marital distress were at heightened risk for intent to divorce at Time 2, even after accounting for PTSD symptoms. This finding suggests higher levels of combat exposure may influence willingness to stay in a distressed marriage; possible mechanisms for this, such as changes in life priorities, are discussed.",

However, because boundaries are permeable, service members remain a psychological part of their families in spite of their physical absence. The extent of service members' continued involvement in daily family life is likely tied to their non-deployed family members' actions to manage this boundary. In the current study, we were interested in identifying non-deployed family members' actions to either promote, or limit, service members' involvement in daily family life during deployment. These actions by family members constitute boundary management behaviors. We collected qualitative data from a sample of Army reservists ( N = 13) and their household family members ( N = 15). Findings indicated that family members used a variety of boundary management behaviors during deployment, some of which promoted reservists' involvement, and others which limited it. In addition, boundary management behaviors varied by who they targeted, their intentionality, and their implications for reservists' well-being. Findings illustrate the value in equipping military families with language that enables them to communicate openly about the significance of their boundary management behavior over the course of deployment so that they may arrive at a balance between stretching and restricting boundaries that best suits their unique needs.",

Latent class analysis was used to classify children into 4 profiles of classroom engagement: free play, individual instruction, group instruction, and scaffolded learning. Free play children exhibited smaller gains across the prekindergarten year on indicators of language/literacy and mathematics compared to other children. Individual instruction children made greater gains than other children on the Woodcock Johnson Applied Problems. Poor children in the individual instruction profile fared better than nonpoor children in that profile; in all other snapshot profiles, poor children fared worse than nonpoor children.",

Veteran responses to the PHQ-15, assessing physical health; the PCL-C, assessing PTSD symptoms; and reports of family challenges were drawn from a countywide veterans survey. Findings indicate physical health (OR = 1.048; 95% CI, 1.002, 1.098) and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptomatology (OR = 1.019; 95% CI, 1.004, 1.034) independently predicted increased child difficulties. Similarly, physical health (OR = 1.081; 95% CI, 1.012, 1.154) and PTSD symptoms (OR = 1.043; 95% CI, 1.022, 1.065) independently impacted relationship difficulties. Using standardized coefficients to compare, PTSD symptoms were a stronger predictor across both models. Results highlight the dual importance of assessing both veterans\u2019 physical and mental health symptoms to understand family functioning. Additionally, these findings underscore the importance of longitudinal research, which can follow families beyond separation from the military.",

Seventy-three patients responded to optimism questionnaires (i.e., the LOT, Generalized Self-Efficacy Scale) and outcome questionnaires. In confirmatory factor analyses, the underlying dimensions of optimism were specified. Explanatory structural equation modeling was used to examine the relation of the dimensions of optimism to coping (CISS), depression (BDI), and impaired mobility range (SIP). Optimism was found to consist of three dimensions, namely, outcome expectancies, efficacy expectancies, and unrealistic thinking. Outcome and efficacy expectancies explained depression via emotion-oriented coping but did not explain impaired mobility range either directly or indirectly. Unrealistic thinking directly explained impaired mobility range. The present study can be seen as a first step in explicating the role of optimism in the management of chronic disease.",

Understanding the consequences of war is critical as a public health concern and because additional resources may be needed to support military families.\nObjective: To determine whether rates of adverse outcomes are higher for military-connected adolescents during war compared with nonmilitary peers.\nDesign, Setting, and Participants: This study is a secondary data analysis of a large, normative, and geographically comprehensive administrative data set (2013 California Healthy Kids Survey) to determine whether military-connected youth are at risk for adverse outcomes, including substance use, experiencing violence and harassment, and weapon carrying, during wartime. These outcomes are of particular concern because they affect socioemotional adjustment and academic success. Data were collected in March and April 2013 and participants included 54,679 military-connected and 634,034 nonmilitary-connected secondary school students from public civilian schools in every county and almost all school districts in California.\nMain Outcomes and Measures: Outcomes included lifetime and recent use of alcohol, tobacco, marijuana, prescription medications, and other drugs, as well as experiences of physical and nonphysical violence and harassment and weapon carrying during the last year.\nResults: Multivariable logistic regression models indicated that military-connected youth had greater odds of substance use, experience of physical violence and nonphysical harassment, and weapon carrying. For example, military-connected youth had 73% greater odds of recent other drug use (eg, cocaine and lysergic acid diethylamide; odds ratio [OR], 1.73; 95% CI, 1.66-1.80) and twice the odds of bringing a gun to school (OR, 2.20; 95% CI, 2.10-2.30) compared with nonmilitary-connected peers. Their odds of being threatened with a weapon or being in a fight were also significantly higher than their civilian counterparts (OR, 1.87; 95% CI, 1.80-1.95 and OR, 1.67; 95% CI, 1.62-1.71, respectively).\nConclusions and Relevance: Most military-connected youth demonstrate resilience. However, results suggest that during wartime, military-connected youth are at increased risk for adverse outcomes. Further, when compared with data from 2011, the rates of these negative outcomes appear to be increasing. These findings suggest a need to identify and intervene with military-connected adolescents and reflect a larger concern regarding the well-being of military families during wartime.",

Methods: We used data from the Army Study to Assess Risk and Resilience in Service-members to apply propensity score methods to match all 4238 female Regular Army soldiers with administratively recorded sexual assault victimization during 2004 to 2009 to 5 controls per case with similar composite victimization risk. We examined associations of this victimization measure with administratively recorded mental health treatment, suicide attempt, and Army career outcomes over the subsequent 12 months by using survival analysis for dichotomous outcomes and conditional generalized linear models for continuous outcomes. Results: Women with administratively recorded sexual assault had significantly elevated odds ratios (ORs) of subsequent mental health treatment (any, OR= 2.5; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 2.4,2.6; specialty,OR= 3.1;95%CI = 2.9,3.3; inpatient,OR = 2.8;95%CI = 2.5,3.1), posttraumatic stress disorder treatment (any, OR= 6.3; 95% CI = 5.7, 6.9; specialty, OR= 7.7; 95% CI = 6.8, 8.6; inpatient,OR = 6.8; 95% CI = 5.4, 8.6), suicide attempt (OR= 3.0; 95% CI = 2.5, 3.6), demotion (OR= 2.1; 95% CI = 1.9, 2.3), and attrition (OR= 1.2; 95% CI = 1.1, 1.2).

Methods Using latent class analysis (LCA), we examined PTSD symptom heterogeneity in a cohort of participants from the Marine Resiliency Study (MRS), a longitudinal study of combat Marines deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan (N=892). Typologies of PTSD symptom presentation were examined at one month pre-deployment and again one, five, and eight months post-deployment. Results Heterogeneity in PTSD symptom presentation was evident at each assessment point, and the degree of symptom heterogeneity (i.e., the number of classes identified) differed by time point. Symptom patterns stabilized over time from notable symptom fluctuations during the early post-deployment period to high, medium, and low symptom severity by eight months post-deployment. Hypervigilance and exaggerated startle were frequently endorsed by participants in the initial month post-deployment. Flashbacks, amnesia, and foreshortened future were infrequently endorsed. Greater combat exposure, lifespan trauma, and avoidant coping generally predicted worse outcomes. Limitations Data were self-report and may have limited generalizability due to our lack of women and inclusion of only combat Marines. Attrition and re-ranging of data resulted in significant missing data and affected the representativeness of the sample. Conclusions Symptom-level variability is highest in the month following deployment and then stabilizes over time. Should post-deployment assessments occur too soon, they may capture common and transient early post-deployment reactions, particularly anxious arousal.",

We sought to identify risk factors for suicide completions among male Marines who entered basic training in San Diego, California, between June 2001 and October 2010. Suicides that occurred during active-duty military service were counted from June 1, 2001, through June 30, 2012. A total of 108,930 male Marines (66,286 deployers and 42,644 never deployed) were followed for 467,857 person-years of active-duty service time. Of the 790 deaths, 123 (15.6%) were suicides. In the final multivariate hazard model, preservice characteristics of not being a high-school graduate (hazard ratio (HR) = 2.17, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.28, 3.68) and being a smoker at the time of enlistment (HR = 1.91, 95% CI: 1.32, 2.76) were significantly associated with a higher risk for suicide completion. Diagnosed with traumatic brain injury (HR = 4.09, 95% CI: 2.08, 8.05), diagnosed with depression (HR = 2.36, 95% CI: 1.22, 4.58), and received relationship counseling (HR = 3.71, 95% CI: 1.44, 9.54) during military service were significant risks for suicide death. Deployment alone was not significantly associated with a risk for suicide death (HR = 0.53, 95% CI: 0.26, 1.05).",

        "paperAbstract": "Children of depressed mothers have been shown to express behaviour problems to a greater extent than children of non-depressed mothers. The purpose of this study was to examine the persistence of depressive symptoms in mothers and to evaluate the relative importance of symptoms of postpartum depression (PPD) and concurrent maternal symptoms of depression, on child behaviour at age 12. A birth cohort of 1,707 children and their mothers was followed from 3 months after birth to 12 years after birth. Self-reported symptoms of depression in mothers were assessed at baseline and 12-year follow-up where 893 mothers (52.3 %) and their children participated. The mothers\u2019 reports on the behaviour of their children at age 12 were used. Multivariate analysis was used to assess factors that increased the risk of child behaviour problems. At baseline, 10.4 % scored above the cutoff for symptoms of postpartum depression. At follow up, 18.2 % scored above the cutoff for depressive symptoms. Multivariate analysis showed that ongoing maternal symptoms of depression, as distinct from PPD-symptoms, was the strongest predictor of child behaviour problems at age 12. The gender of the child and socio-demographic factors at baseline were additional factors that affected the risk of behaviour problems in the 12 year old children. Children of mothers who reported symptoms of depression, both postpartum and at follow-up, were at a greater risk of behaviour problems compared to children of women with no depressive symptoms on either occasion. Our findings indicate that recurrent and ongoing maternal depressive symptoms significantly increase the risk of child behaviour problems as reported by mothers, while symptoms of PPD do not seem to result in an increased risk of behaviour problems in 12 year olds. High maternal socio-demographic life stress at childbirth constitutes an important risk factor for later child behaviour problems.",

        "paperAbstract": "Objective: The U.S. Air Force recently implemented system-wide changes that both (a) clarified the criteria used to determine when family maltreatment has occurred and (b) made the process by which these decisions are made more consistent. The current study examined the effects of these changes on family maltreatment recidivism. Method: Official records were obtained from the Air Force Family Advocacy Program. All cases decided during the last year of the old system and the first year of the new system at each base (total N \u03ed 14,298) were examined. For each incident, it was determined (a) whether the incident met criteria and (b) whether the same offender committed family maltreatment again within 1 year of the initial incident. Results: Overall substantiation rates were significantly lower (p \u03ed .003) under the new system (47%) than the old (56%). After the change, significant interaction effects were obtained for both alleged (b \u03ed \u03ea.51, p \u03ed .004) and substantiated (b \u03ed \u03ea.55, p \u03ed .015) reoffense, in that 1-year reoffense rates decreased significantly among initially substantiated cases but remained unchanged among initially unsubstantiated cases. Indeed, rates of substantiated reoffense by substantiated offenders were cut in half (from 14% to 7%). Conclusions: Reductions in overall substantiation rates were most likely due to the use of more stringent criteria. The results of the recidivism analyses suggest that clear criteria and consistent decision processes can have secondary preventive effects on family maltreatment in their own right, possibly due to increases in informal community sanctions.",

The participants without children exhibited significantly more PTSD symptoms compared with the participants with children but did not differ in lateral preference levels. Multiple linear regression analysis revealed an altered pattern in the relationship between PTSD symptoms severity and lateral preference between the two groups. This alternation could suggest that being a parent might compel a reservist to inhibit the use of avoidance mechanisms for coping with intrusive memories, resulting in reduction of visible symptoms of PTSD while respectively contributing to their synchronization to lateral preference.",

We achieved a 62% response rate in our Survey for Prosthetic Use from 298 Vietnam war veterans and 283 servicemembers/veterans from Operation Iraqi Freedom/Operation Enduring Freedom (OIF/OEF) who sustained major traumatic limb loss. Participants reported their combat injuries; health status; quality of life; and prosthetic device use, function, rejection, and satisfaction. Despite the serious injuries experienced, health status was rated excellent, very good, or good by 70.7% of Vietnam war and 85.5% of OIF/OEF survey participants. However, many health issues persist for Vietnam war and OIF/OEF survey participants (respectively): phantom limb pain (72.2%/76.0%), chronic back pain (36.2%/42.1%), residual\u00adlimb pain (48.3%/62.9%), prosthesis\u00ad related skin problems (51.0%/58.0%), hearing loss (47.0%/47.0%), traumatic brain injury (3.4%/33.9%), depression (24.5%/24.0%), and posttraumatic stress disorder (37.6%/58.7%). Prosthetic devices are currently used by 78.2% of Vietnam war and 90.5% of OIF/OEF survey participants to improve function and mobility. On average, the annual rate for prosthetic device receipt is 10.7\u00adfold higher for OIF/OEF than for Vietnam war survey participants.

Participants were placed into 1 of 3 exposure groups based on their deployment status at follow-up: nondeployed, survey completed during deployment, or survey completed postdeployment. Interventions: N/A Measurements and Results: Study outcomes were self-reported sleep duration and trouble sleeping, defined as having trouble falling asleep or staying asleep. Adjusted mean sleep duration was significantly shorter among those in the deployed and postdeployment groups compared with those who did not deploy. Additionally, male gender and greater stress were significantly associated with shorter sleep duration. Personnel who completed their survey during deployment or postdeployment were significantly more likely to have trouble sleeping than those who had not deployed. Lower self-reported general health, female gender, and reporting of mental health symptoms at baseline were also significantly associated with increased odds of trouble sleeping. Conclusions: Deployment significantly influenced sleep quality and quantity in this population though effect size was mediated with statistical modeling that included mental health symptoms. Personnel reporting combat exposures or mental health symptoms had increased odds of trouble sleeping. These findings merit further research to increase understanding of temporal relationships between sleep and mental health outcomes occurring during and after deployment.",

        "paperAbstract": "Sleep disturbances are prevalent in posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and are associated with a number of adverse health consequences. Few studies have used comprehensive assessment methods to characterize sleep in Operation Iraqi Freedom/Operation Enduring Freedom/Operation New Dawn (OEF/OIF/OND) veterans with PTSD. OEF/OIF/OND veterans with PTSD and sleep disturbance (n = 45) were compared to patients with primary insomnia (n = 25) and healthy control subjects (n = 27). Participants were assessed using questionnaire-based measures as well as daily subjective and objective measures of sleep. The 3 groups were compared with regard to (a) group means, (b) intraindividual (i.e., night-to-night) variability of sleep, and (c) interindividual (i.e., within-group) variability of sleep. In terms of group means, only objective sleep efficiency was significantly worse with PTSD than with primary insomnia (d = 0.54). Those with PTSD differed from those with primary insomnia on measures of intraindividual as well as interindividual variability (d = 0.48\u20130.73). These results suggested sleep symptoms in OEF/OIF/OND veterans with PTSD are more variable across nights and less consistent across patients relative to sleep symptoms in insomnia patients without PTSD. These findings have implications for research, as well as for personalizing treatment for individuals with PTSD.",

        "paperAbstract": "Background:\u00a0More than 90% of fathers in the United States attend the births of their children. Each year, thousands of fathers are absent during this important life transition because of military deployment in combat regions; however, it is unknown how this population experiences new fatherhood. Objective:\u00a0The purpose of this study was to explore the lived experience of first-time fatherhood from the unique perspective of military men deployed to combat regions during birth. Method:\u00a0A phenomenological approach was used. Seventeen men who were stationed in Okinawa, Japan, and had returned recently from a combat deployment participated. Unstructured, in-depth interviews were conducted 2 to 6 months after the births. Interviews were audiotaped, transcribed, and analyzed using Colaizzi's method. Results:\u00a0Disruption of the protector and provider role was a main theme that encompassed four theme clusters: (a) worry-a traumatic and lonely childbirth; (b) lost opportunity; (c) guilt-an absent father; and (d) fear of death and dismemberment-who will be the father? Although their absence interfered with their ability to fulfill the fatherhood role as they perceived it, this was offset by the theme cluster Communication: The ties that bind, highlighting the role of online communication with their partner (e.g., e-mail, instant messaging, Facebook\u2122, blogs, and chat rooms) in restoring balance to the protector and provider role. Discussion:\u00a0Insight is provided into the needs of first-time fathers who are combat-deployed during the births of their babies. Understanding these experiences assists nurses in identifying better ways to prepare and to support men in an involved fatherhood role, despite the limitations of a stressful combat environment and geographic separation. This information can set the stage for a healthy reunion, which may take place at military bases and within communities across the globe, and thus is of benefit to all nurses working with military families.",

A stratified sample of 128,950 United States Active Duty members were invited to participate in an Air Force-wide anonymous online survey across 82 bases. The final sample (N = 52,780) was weighted to be representative of the United States Air Force. Backward stepwise regression analyses were conducted to identify unique predictors of partner physical aggression perpetration within and across different ecological levels (individual, family, organization, and community levels). Relationship satisfaction, alcohol problems, financial stress, and number of years in the military were identified as unique predictors of men\u2019s and women\u2019s perpetration of violence against their partner across ecological levels. Parental status, support from neighbors, personal coping, and support from formal agencies also uniquely predicted men\u2019s but not women\u2019s perpetration of violence across ecological levels. This study identified specific risk factors of partner violence that may be targeted by prevention and intervention efforts aimed at different levels of impact (e.g., family interventions, community-wide programs).",

Fourteen male service members, previously deployed to a combat zone, parent to at least one child under seven years of age, were interviewed about their relationships with their young children. Principles of grounded theory guided data analysis to identify key themes related to parenting young children after deployment. Participants reported significant levels of parenting stress and identified specific challenges, including difficulty reconnecting with children, adapting expectations from military to family life, and coparenting. Fathers acknowledged regret about missing an important period in their child's development and indicated a strong desire to improve their parenting skills. They described a need for support in expressing emotions, nurturing, and managing their tempers. Results affirm the need for support to military families during reintegration and demonstrate that military fathers are receptive to opportunities to engage in parenting interventions. Helping fathers understand their children's behavior in the context of age-typical responses to separation and reunion may help them to renew parent\u2013child relationships and reengage in optimal parenting of their young children.",

Grief, a correlate of health problems in the general population, has not been systematically examined. We aimed to identify the prevalence of post-deployment physical health problems and their association with difficulty coping with grief. Methods Infantry soldiers (n=1522) completed anonymous surveys using validated instruments six months following deployment in November\u2013December 2008. Multiple logistic regression was used to assess the association of difficulty coping with grief and physical health. Results The most frequent physical health symptoms reported were: sleep problems (32.8%), musculoskeletal pain (32.7%), fatigue (32.3%), and back pain (28.1%). Difficulty coping with grief over the death of someone close affected 21.3%. There was a dose\u2013response relationship between level of difficulty coping with grief and principal physical health outcomes (ps<.002). Controlling for demographics, combat experiences, injuries, PTSD, depression, and other factors, grief significantly and uniquely contributed to a high somatic symptom score (adjusted odds ratio (AOR)=3.6), poor general health (AOR=2.0), missed work (AOR=1.7), medical utilization (AOR=1.5), difficulty carrying a heavy load (AOR=1.7), and difficulty performing physical training (AOR=1.6; all 95% confidence intervals >1). Limitations Data are cross-sectional and grief was measured with one item. Conclusions Over 20% of soldiers reported difficulty coping with grief. This difficulty was significantly associated with physical health outcomes and occupational impairment. Clinicians should be aware of the unique role grief plays in post-deployment physical health when treating patients.",

        "paperAbstract": "On the occasion of my retirement from the University of Minnesota, a symposium was held to encourage the continuation of research about ambiguous loss and boundary ambiguity. This special issue continues that goal. The papers herein illustrate how a new generation of scientists and practitioners applies ambiguous loss theory to understand previously unstudied situations and populations. Their work generates new questions and hypotheses and, hopefully, stimulates others to join the ongoing process of research, practice, and theorizing. Ambiguous loss is a loss that remains unclear. The premise of the ambiguous loss theory is that uncertainty or a lack of information about the whereabouts or status of a loved one as absent or present, as dead or alive, is traumatizing for most individuals, couples, and families. At the core of this collection of papers in this special issue are the following assumptions: Ambiguous loss theory assumes that a psychological family exists and that this perceived construction of one's family may differ from the physical or legal family structure, ambiguous loss as an external situation is assumed to be neutral, it is assumed that cultural beliefs and values influence a family's tolerance for ambiguity and how it is perceived, we assume that with situations of ambiguous loss, truth is unattainable and thus relative.

With limited existing research on outcomes related to participation, this study explored to what extent participation in OMK camps affected military youth\u2019s self-efficacy for communication, coping, and social skills. Participants responded to an online instrument three months after camp. Both campers and parents reported the largest increase in self-efficacy for communication skills, followed by social skills, and then coping skills. Open-ended responses overwhelmingly supported that developing friendships was one of the greatest benefits of attending a camp. The results are consistent with the literature regarding the importance of connectedness. Recommendations for conducting camps are offered. These finding may also be useful to those working with other special populations in the camp setting.",

This investigation was a longitudinal study of U.S. Air Force security forces assigned to a year-long high-threat ground mission in Iraq to determine the degree to which airmen's emotional and behavioral health and committed relationships were adversely impacted by an extended deployment to a warzone. Participants were a cohort of 164 security forces airmen tasked to a 365-day deployment to train Iraqi police. Airmen completed study measures both prior to and 6-9 months following deployment. Rates of deterioration in individual and interpersonal adjustment were both significant and medium to large in magnitude of effect, d = 0.43 to 0.90. Results suggest that the negative effects of deployment are related to levels of traumatic experiences and do not spontaneously remit within the first 6-9 months following return from deployment-particularly among those service members having relatively lower levels of social support.",

Whereas, in recent years, there has been increasingly more research on dual-career marriages (i.e. both spouses work, but not necessarily at the same workplace and/or occupation), there has been very little research on work-linked marriages. The current study focuses on work resources (i.e. family supportive supervisor behaviour and job control) as key mediating processes that explain the effect of gender on turnover intentions among work-linked employees in masculine occupations (i.e. military). Investigating gender differences is important because, compared with men, women are more likely to be in work-linked marriages and to leave their jobs. Based on role theory and conservation of resource theory, we predicted that gender was related to turnover intentions, and this relationship would be mediated by key explanatory variables (i.e. family supportive supervisor behaviours, job control and psychological distress). Mediation analyses, conducted on a sample of men and women in work-linked marriages (n = 309), provide support for the hypothesized model. These findings offer guidance for understanding gender differences among work-linked employees in masculine occupations, and how these differences can affect important outcomes such as turnover intentions.

Most children are resilient to the effects of deployment of at least one of their parents, but children with preexisting psychological conditions, such as anxiety and depression, may be particularly vulnerable, as well as children with specific risk factors, such as child abuse, family violence, or parental substance abuse.

Purpose To provide estimates of several leading U.S. health indicators by military service status among women. Methods Data were obtained from the 2010 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance Survey, a U.S. population-based study. Health outcomes were compared by military status using multivariable logistic regression among the female participants (274,399 civilians, 4221 veterans, 661 active duty, and 995 National Guard or Reserves [NG/R]). Data were analyzed in August 2011. Results Veterans reported poorer general health and greater incidence of health risk behaviors, mental health conditions, and chronic health conditions than civilian women. Active duty women reported better access to health care, better physical health, less engagement in health risk behaviors, and greater likelihood of having had a recent Pap than civilian women. Women from the NG/R were comparable to civilians across most health domains, although they had a greater likelihood of being overweight or obese and reporting a depressive and anxiety disorder. Conclusions Compared with civilian women, NG/R women rated their health and access to health care similarly and active duty women rated theirs better on several domains, but veterans consistently reported poorer health.",

We aim to determine the impact of parental deployment and combat injury on young children\u2019s postdeployment mental health, injuries, and maltreatment. Method This is a population-based, retrospective cohort study of young children of active duty military parents during fiscal years (FY) 2006 to 2007, a high deployment period. A total of 487,460 children, 3 to 8 years of age, who received Military Health System care, were included. The relative rates of mental health, injury, and child maltreatment visits of children whose parents deployed and children of combat-injured parents were compared to children unexposed to parental deployment. Results Of the included children, 58,479 (12%) had a parent deploy, and 5,405 (1%) had a parent injured during\u00a0deployment. Relative to children whose parents did not deploy, children of deployed and combat-injured parents, respectively, had additional visits for mental health diagnoses (incidence rate ratio [IRR]\u00a0= 1.09 [95% CI\u00a0= 1.02\u20131.17], IRR\u00a0= 1.67 [95% CI\u00a0= 1.47\u20131.89]), injuries (IRR\u00a0= 1.07 [95% CI\u00a0= 1.04\u20131.09], IRR\u00a0= 1.24 [95% CI\u00a0= 1.17\u20131.32]), and child maltreatment (IRR\u00a0= 1.21 [95% CI\u00a0= 1.11\u20131.32], IRR 2.30\u00a0= [95% CI 2.02\u20132.61]) postdeployment. Conclusion Young children of deployed and combat-injured military parents have more postdeployment visits for mental health, injuries, and child maltreatment. Mental health problems, injuries, and maltreatment after a parent\u2019s return from deployment are amplified in children of combat-injured parents. Increased preventive and intervention services are needed for young children as parents return from deployments. Child health and mental health providers are crucial to effective identification of these at-risk children to ensure effective care provision.",

This study examined the affect of a parent's deployment to war on the rate of psychiatric hospitalization among their children. Methods This was a retrospective cohort study. Records of children of active duty personnel during fiscal years 2007 through 2009 were linked with their parent's deployment records. Psychiatric hospitalizations were identified using International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision codes on admission. Odds ratios (OR) of hospitalization were determined using both univariate and multivariate logistic regression. Lengths of hospital stay were also compared by linear regression using Duan's smearing estimate method. Results A total of 377,565 children aged 9\u201317 years were included along with data on both their active duty and civilian parent. Mean child age was 12.53 years (S.D.: 2.5 years); 51% were male. Mean age of active duty parent was 37.8 years (S.D.: 5.2 years); 93% were male, 90% were married and 62% were white. In the study, 2533 children were hospitalized for a mental or behavioral health disorder in fiscal year 2009 with a median length of stay of 8 days. After adjusting for demographic data and past psychiatric history of the child, active duty parent and civilian parent, the OR of hospitalization for children with a recently deployed parent was 1.10 (95% confidence interval: 1.01\u20131.19). The OR of hospitalization increased with increasing length of deployment with a positive test of trend. There was no statistically significant difference in distribution of admission diagnoses or length of hospital stay based on deployment by the active duty parent. Conclusions Psychiatric hospitalization increased by 10% among children aged 9\u201317 years when a military parent was recently deployed. The odds of hospitalization increased with increasing length of a parent's deployment.",

This study extends prior work by examining suicidal ideation, plans, and attempts in military-connected and non military-connected adolescents. Data were gathered from 390,028 9th and 11th grade students who completed the 2012\u20132013 California Healthy Kids Survey. Bivariate comparisons and multivariate logistic analyses were conducted to examine differences in suicidal ideation, plans, attempts, and attempts requiring medical attention between military and not military-connected youth. In multivariate logistic analyses, military-connected youth were at increased risk for suicidal ideation (OR = 1.43, 95 % CI = 1.37\u20131.49), making a plan to harm themselves (OR = 1.19, CI = 1.06\u20131.34), attempting suicide (OR = 1.67, CI = 1.43\u20131.95), and an attempted suicide which required medical treatment (OR = 1.71, CI = 1.34\u20132.16). These results indicate that military-connected youth statewide are at a higher risk for suicidal ideation, plans, attempts, and attempts requiring medical care because of suicidal behaviors. It is suggested that policies be implemented to increase awareness and screening among primary care providers, school personnel, and military organizations that serve military-connected youth.",

We included US Marine Corps personnel identified from military deployment records who deployed to Operation Iraqi Freedom once (n = 49,328) or twice (n = 16,376). New-onset mental health diagnoses from military medical databases were included. We calculated the ratio of dwell-to-deployment time (DDR) as the length of time between deployments divided by the length of the first deployment. Marines with 2 deployments had higher rates of PTSD than did those with 1 deployment (2.1% versus 1.2%; P < .001). A DDR representing longer dwell times at home relative to first deployment length was associated with reduced odds of PTSD (odds ratio [OR] = 0.47; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.32, 0.70), PTSD with other mental health disorder (OR = 0.56; 95% CI = 0.33, 0.94), and other mental health disorders (OR = 0.62; 95% CI = 0.51, 0.75).

For such efforts to be maximally effective, comprehensive information regarding factors that increase or decrease risk for hazardous drinking is necessary. This is the first study to investigate risk and promotive factors across individual, family, community, and organizational levels in a representative sample of Air Force personnel (N = 52,780). Unique predictors of men's and women's hazardous drinking were identified both within and across ecological levels. Predictors that accounted for the most variance in predicting hazardous versus non-hazardous drinkers included family income, number of children, depressive symptoms, religious involvement, and perceived financial stress for men and women; and years in the military for men. Among hazardous drinkers, a different set of predictors best explained variance in severity of drinking problems. Results of the current study help identify key targets for prevention efforts operating at different levels (e.g., individual therapy, community-wide programs).",

        "paperAbstract": "The more than decade long tempo of war has taken a considerable toll on military families, with the rates of mental health concerns in non-deployed spouses on the rise. To date, few evidence-based programs exist to meet the unique needs of military spouses. The current study presents early findings from the development and implementation of HomeFront Strong (HFS), an 8 week group-based resiliency intervention designed to support military spouses through deployment transitions. In three group cohorts, 20 women completed the HFS intervention, and 14 of those participants provided evaluation data at the pre-group and 3 month follow up (3MFU) assessments, including a semi-structured interview designed to elicit a personal narrative about deployment experiences. Thematic analyses of the personal narratives demonstrated that negative cognitions (e.g., helplessness; feeling unsupported) about deployment were associated with higher rates of depression prior to group participation. At 3MFU, personal narratives included more positive cognitions and fewer negative cognitions, suggesting that HFS changed the way spouses thought about their deployment experiences. Moreover, participants reported fewer symptoms of depression, higher levels of social support, and greater life satisfaction at 3MFU. While this Phase I study is small and lacks a comparison group, the demonstration of positive results is promising and warrants further attention.

A big part of the reason, write Anita Chandra and Andrew London, is the lack of sufficiently robust sources of data. Until more and better data are collected about military families, Chandra and London say, it will be difficult to study the breadth of their experiences and sources of resilience, distinguish among subgroups within the diverse military community, or compare military children with their civilian counterparts. After surveying the available sources of data and explaining what they are lacking and why, Chandra and London make several recommendations. First, they say, major longitudinal national surveys, as well as administrative data systems (for example, in health care and in schools), should routinely ask about children's connections to the military, so that military families can be flagged in statistical analyses. Second, questions on national surveys and psychological assessments should be formulated and calibrated for military children to be certain that they resonate with military culture. Third, researchers who study military children should consider adopting a life-course perspective, examining children from birth to adulthood as they and their families move through the transitions of military life and into or out of the civilian world.",

Main Outcome Measure:\u00a0Cognitive performance, measured by the Armed Forces Qualification Test percentile score, completed at 2 time points: preinjury and 40 years postinjury. Design:\u00a0On the basis of caregivers' attachment style (secure, fearful, preoccupied, dismissing), participants with TBI were grouped into a high or low group. To examine the association between cognitive trajectory of participants with TBI and caregivers' attachment style, we ran four 2 \u00d7 2 analysis of covariance on cognitive performances. Results:\u00a0After controlling for other factors, cognitive decline was more pronounced in participants with TBI with a high fearful caregiver than among those with a low fearful caregiver. Other attachment styles were not associated with decline. Conclusion and Implication:\u00a0Caregiver fearful attachment style is associated with a significant decline in cognitive status after TBI. We interpret this result in the context of the neural plasticity and cognitive reserve literatures.

The sample comprised 3,914 parents from eight school districts in the San Diego area. The parents completed the core and MC parent modules of the California School Climate Survey for Parents. Approximately 10 percent identified themselves as MC. Military parents provided significantly more negative assessments of schools' climate and encouragement for parental involvement compared with nonmilitary parents in the same schools. Nevertheless, they saw fewer violence problems in schools compared with nonmilitary parents. Military parents' most pressing need was for information on educational resources for military families. Although military parents were satisfied with many aspects of the school, a relatively large proportion expressed dissatisfaction with a sense of connection to other families in the school, the degree of understanding that staff showed them, and the responsiveness of the school administration to their concerns. Educators and social workers may need more training regarding military culture and the needs of military students and families. Programs should be developed to effectively involve military parents in schools and address their needs.",

Latent growth curve analysis revealed a progressive decline in self-regulatory efficacy from junior to senior high school, with males experiencing the greater reduction. The lower the decline in self-regulatory efficacy, the higher the high school grades and the greater the likelihood of remaining in high school controlling for socioeconomic status. Reciprocal cross-lagged models revealed that high perceived efficacy for self-regulated learning in junior high school contributed to junior high school grades and self-regulatory efficacy in high school, which partially mediated the relation of junior high grades on high school grades and the likelihood of remaining in school. Socioeconomic status contributed to high school grades only mediationally through junior high grades and to school drop out both directly and mediationally through junior high grades.",

During the Vietnam War, support for military action was stronger among men, whites, the more educated, the more affluent, and younger persons. In the post-Vietnam era, men have remained consistently more supportive of military action, despite recent changes in gender roles and gender politics. Racial differences have remained strong, but not uniformly so. The gap between whites and nonwhites has been most pronounced in periods of intense partisanship or when military events have sparked a \"rally-'round-the-flag\" response that affected whites more than nonwhites. Education and income differences have generally followed a similar pattern, although there are signs of a weakening (or even reversal) of differences in attitudes to war on the education variable. Another change in the post-Vietnam era has been the relative decline in support for military action among younger persons. These data are used to explore the diverse causes and meanings of attitudes toward the use of military force and to assess the implications of the social distribution of pro-and antiwar opinion for the conduct of U. S foreign policy and political mobilization on issues of war and peace. Keywords: militarism, public opinion, foreign policy, Vietnam War, Iraq War.",

        "paperAbstract": "Objective: To evaluate the association of spousal deployment during the antenatal period on maternal and neonatal outcomes and to estimate whether group prenatal care may be beneficial in reducing adverse outcomes when spouses are deployed.\nMethods: Primigravid women who delivered at Womack Army Medical Center, Fort Bragg, North Carolina, were prospectively enrolled and selected for participation on a random basis between January 2013 and January 2014. Women whose spouses were deployed to a combat zone during the entire pregnancy (deployed group) were compared with women whose spouses were not deployed during the pregnancy (nondeployed group). Pregnancy and neonatal outcomes were compared between groups.\nResults: Three hundred ninety-seven women were enrolled with 183 (46.1%) in the deployed group and 214 (53.9%) in the nondeployed group. Spouse deployment was associated with increased risk of preterm delivery (38 [20.8%] compared with 16 [7.5%], P<.001) and postpartum depression (30 [16.4%] compared with 13 [6.1%], P=.001) when compared with women in the nondeployed group. There were no differences in the incidence of preterm delivery and postpartum depression for women in the deployed group who participated in group prenatal care when compared with women participating in traditional care (preterm delivery 6 [14.6%] compared with 32 [22.5%], P=.38; postpartum depression 4 [9.8%] compared with 26 [18.3%], P=.24).\nConclusion: Women who have a spouse deployed during their pregnancy are at increased risk for preterm birth and postpartum depression. Larger studies are needed to evaluate whether spouse deployment during pregnancy has other perinatal effects and whether group prenatal care may have a positive effect on adverse perinatal outcomes in this population.\nLevel Of Evidence: II.",

        "paperAbstract": "The US military community includes a population of mostly young families that reside in every state and the District of Columbia. Many reside on or near military installations, while other National Guard, Reserve, and Veteran families live in civilian communities and receive care from clinicians with limited experience in the treatment of military families. Though all military families may have vulnerabilities based upon their exposure to deployment-related experiences, those affected by combat injury have unique additional risks that must be understood and effectively managed by military, Veterans Affairs, and civilian practitioners. Combat injury can weaken interpersonal relationships, disrupt day-to-day schedules and activities, undermine the parental and interpersonal functions that support children's health and well-being, and disconnect families from military resources. Treatment of combat-injured service members must therefore include a family-centered strategy that lessens risk by promoting positive family adaptation to ongoing stressors. This article reviews the nature and epidemiology of combat injury, the known impact of injury and illness on military and civilian families, and effective strategies for maintaining family health while dealing with illness and injury.",

Methods: Retrospective chart reviews were conducted to collect data on weight and symptoms of PTSD and depression. Results: Mean body mass index (=27 kg/m2, SD = 4.47) was within the overweight range. Veterans had rates of overweight that were higher than those of national samples of individuals in the same age group, but had lower rates of obesity. Measures of symptoms of PTSD and depression were not associated with weight. Conclusions: A high proportion of individuals in this group of Operation Enduring Freedom/Operation Iraqi Freedom Veterans is overweight with rates consistent with the larger active duty population. Overweight was not associated with psychological distress. These data raise concerns for long-term problems with weight in this group of Veterans.",

Neglect rates decreased from a high point in 1991 to a low in 2000, but by 2004 the rates had increased to about the 1991 level. During two large-scale deployments of the US Army to the Middle East (1991 and 2002\u20132004), the rates of neglect increased. Neglect rates were highest for the youngest children and decreased as age increased. Physical abuse rates decreased from 1990\u20132004, but the decline was slowed during 2001\u201304. Physical abuse was more severe by male offenders. Emotional abuse showed wide fluctuations in rates. Emotional abuse rates were similar for boys and girls up to age 11, but the rates for older girls were higher. Sexual abuse had the lowest rates throughout the time of this report, decreasing from about 0.5/1000 to about 0.1/1000. The rates of physical abuse and neglect were generally higher for boys than for girls up to the teenage years when the rates reversed. Male offenders were more likely to maltreat children (even excluding sexual abuse) than were female offenders and offenders of both sexes were more likely to abuse male children. We provide suggestions for practice, prevention and research in child maltreatment.",

This study aimed to characterize experiences with suicide exposure and their associations with lifetime and current psychiatric symptoms among military service members and veterans. Methods A sample of 1753 United States military service members and veterans completed self-report questionnaires assessing experiences with suicide exposure, lifetime history of suicidal thoughts and behaviors, current suicidal symptoms, and perceived likelihood of making a future suicide attempt. Results The majority of participants (57.3%) reported knowing someone who had died by suicide, and of these individuals, most (53.1%) reported having lost a friend to suicide. Chi-square tests, one-way ANOVAs, and logistic regression analyses revealed that those who reported knowing a suicide decedent were more likely to report more severe current suicidal symptoms and a history of suicidal thoughts and behaviors compared to those who did not know a suicide decedent. Hierarchical linear regression analyses indicated that greater self-reported interpersonal closeness to a suicide decedent predicted greater self-reported likelihood of a future suicide attempt, even after controlling for current suicidal symptoms and prior suicidal thoughts and behaviors. Limitations This study utilized cross-sectional data, and information regarding degree of exposure to suicide was not collected. Conclusions Military personnel and veterans who have been bereaved by suicide may themselves be at elevated risk for suicidal thoughts and behaviors. Additional work is needed to delineate the relationship between these experiences.",

METHODS: From May 2011 to January 2012, we conducted 22 telephone interviews with US servicewomen deployed overseas between 2002 and 2011. We analyzed data thematically with modified grounded theory methods. RESULTS: Factors identified as contributing to MST included deployment dynamics, military culture, and lack of consequences for perpetrators. Participants attributed low MST reporting to negative reactions and blame from peers and supervisors, concerns about confidentiality, and stigma. Unit cohesion was cited as both a facilitator and a barrier to reporting. Availability and awareness of MST services during deployment varied. Barriers to care seeking were similar to reporting barriers and included confidentiality concerns and stigma. We identified several avenues to address MST, including strengthening consequences for perpetrators. CONCLUSIONS: We identified barriers to MST reporting and services. Better understanding of these issues will allow policymakers to improve MST prevention and services.",

A total of 148 adolescents completed self-report measures of prosocial and aggressive behavior, moral affect, moral cognition, negative emotionality, and attribution biases. Although in general all 3 factors (emotional, moral, and social cognitive) were correlated with adolescent social behavior, the most consistent independent predictors of adolescent social behavior were moral affect and cognition. These findings have important implications for intervention and suggest that programs that promote adolescent perspective taking, moral reasoning, and moral affect are needed to reduce aggressive behavior and promote prosocial behavior.",

However, these studies have not compared incidence rates of psychiatric disorders across robust cohorts, nor have they documented psychiatric problems prior to combat exposure. The authors' objectives in this study were to determine incidence rates of diagnosed mental disorders in a cohort of Marines deployed to combat during OIF or OEF in 2001\u20132005 and to compare these with mental disorder rates in two historical and two contemporary military control groups. After exclusion of persons who had been deployed to a combat zone with a preexisting psychiatric diagnosis, the cumulative rate of post-OIF/-OEF mental disorders was 6.4%. All psychiatric conditions except post-traumatic stress disorder occurred at a lower rate in combat-deployed personnel than in personnel who were not deployed to a combat zone. The findings suggest that psychiatric disorders in Marines are diagnosed most frequently during the initial months of recruit training rather than after combat deployment. The disproportionate loss of psychologically unfit personnel early in training creates a \u201chealthy warrior effect,\u201d because only those persons who have proven their resilience during training remain eligible for combat.",

Patients and methods Canadian male military personnel with PTSD, who despite standard treatment continued to experience trauma-related nightmares, received double-blind treatment with 0.5mg NAB or placebo (PBO), and then titrated to the effective dose (nightmare suppression) or reaching a maximum of 3.0mg. Subjects were followed for 7 weeks and then, following a 2-week washout period, were titrated with the other study treatment and followed for an additional 7 weeks. The modified intent-to-treat (mITT) population, which included all treated subjects that met inclusion/exclusion criteria, was analyzed. Results Ten subjects were included in the mITT population. The mean reduction in nightmares as measured by the CAPS Recurring and Distressing Dream scores were \u22123.6\u00b12.4 and \u22121.0\u00b12.1 in the NAB and PBO groups, respectively (p=0.03). Mean global improvement as measured by the Clinical Global Impression of Change (CGI-C) was 1.9\u00b11.1 (i.e. much improved) and 3.2\u00b11.2 (i.e. minimally improved) in the NAB and PBO groups, respectively (p=0.05) Five out of 10 (50%) were much improved on NAB versus 1 out of 9 (11%) on PBO. Results for the General Well Being Questionnaire (WBQ) were 20.8\u00b122 and \u22120.4\u00b120.6 in the NAB and PBO groups, respectively (p=0.04). The proportion of subjects who experienced a treatment-related occurrence of adverse events was 50% in the NBO group and 60% in the PBO group. No event was severe nor resulted in a drop-out. This study is registered with Health Canada. Conclusion In this small sample NAB provided significant relief for military personnel with PTSD, indicating that it shows promise as a clinically-relevant treatment for patients with nightmares and a history of non-response to traditional therapies. These findings need to be replicated in a larger cohort. There is a need for further exploration of the effect of nabilone on other symptoms of PTSD such as re-experiencing, hyper vigilance and insomnia.",

Our study sought to identify the prevalence and impact of symptoms of mental health problems in Canadian Forces (CF) personnel serving in Task Force Afghanistan; and, to determine the use of, and perceived need for, mental health services in CF personnel while deployed.Methods:Our study consisted of a cross-sectional survey of all 2779 CF personnel deployed to the province of Kandahar, Afghanistan, from February 15, 2010, to March 15,2010.Results:An important minority (8.5%) of the 1572 respondents (response rate = 57%) exceeded civilian criteria for symptoms of acute traumatic stress, major depression, or generalized anxiety. Prevalence of these 3 mental health problems increased with higher combat exposure and location in more isolated posts. A much larger fraction (31 %) reported suffering a stress, emotional, alcohol, or family problem during the deployment. Only a minority of respondents with a mental health problem (26%) were currently interested in getting help. Almost one-half of respondents with a mental health problem perceived occupational dysfunction as a result, though two-thirds of respondents with occupational dysfunction were in the group without the 3 mental health problems assessed.Conclusions:The needs base for psychosocial support extends beyond personnel who meet conventional questionnaire criteria for traumatic stress, depression, or generalized anxiety. Future research is needed to understand what precise problems are driving this larger needs base and what precise supports (clinical or nonclinical) would be most appropriate.",

Social resilience, however, is inherently a multilevel construct, revealed by capacities of individuals, but also groups, to foster, engage in, and sustain positive social relationships and to endure and recover from stressors and social isolation. Emergent levels of organization, ranging from dyads, families, and groups to cities, civilizations, and international alliances have long been apparent in human existence, but identifying the features of individuals, relationships, and group structures and norms that promote social resilience-and determining effective interventions to build social resilience-represent some of the most important challenges facing the military as well as contemporary behavioral science. We identify nine personal resources that foster social resilience, and we describe an educational, computer-based program that builds on these resources in an effort to improve the social resilience among troops in the U.S. Army. Data from this program should provide valuable evidence regarding the challenge of building social resilience.",

        "paperAbstract": "Background Self-assessment of resilience could prove valuable to military and other organizations whose personnel confront foreseen stressors. We evaluated the validity of self-assessed resilience among U.S. Army soldiers, including whether predeployment perceived resilience predicted postdeployment emotional disorder. Methods Resilience was assessed via self-administered questionnaire among new soldiers reporting for basic training (N = 35,807) and experienced soldiers preparing to deploy to Afghanistan (N = 8,558). Concurrent validity of self-assessed resilience was evaluated among recruits by estimating its association with past-month emotional disorder. Predictive validity was examined among 3,526 experienced soldiers with no lifetime emotional disorder predeployment. Predictive models estimated associations of predeployment resilience with incidence of emotional disorder through 9 months postdeployment and with marked improvement in coping at 3 months postdeployment. Weights-adjusted regression models incorporated stringent controls for risk factors. Results Soldiers characterized themselves as very resilient on average [M = 14.34, SD = 4.20 (recruits); M = 14.75, SD = 4.31 (experienced soldiers); theoretical range = 0\u201320]. Demographic characteristics exhibited only modest associations with resilience, while severity of childhood maltreatment was negatively associated with resilience in both samples. Among recruits, resilience was inversely associated with past-month emotional disorder [adjusted odds ratio (AOR) = 0.65, 95% CI = 0.62\u20130.68, P < .0005 (per standard score increase)]. Among deployed soldiers, greater predeployment resilience was associated with decreased incidence of emotional disorder (AOR = 0.91; 95% CI = 0.84\u20130.98; P = .016) and increased odds of improved coping (AOR = 1.36; 95% CI = 1.24\u20131.49; P < .0005) postdeployment. Conclusions Findings supported validity of self-assessed resilience among soldiers, although its predictive effect on incidence of emotional disorder was modest. In conjunction with assessment of known risk factors, measurement of resilience could help predict adaptation to foreseen stressors like deployment.",

Aims This study reports the results of a survey of deployed personnel, examining the perceived impact of events at home and military support for the family on current mental health during the deployment. Method Surveys were conducted with 2042 British forces personnel serving in Iraq and Afghanistan. Prevalence of common mental disorders was assessed with the 12-item General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12) and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) was assessed with the PTSD Checklist \u2013 Civilian version (PCL-C). Results The prevalence of common mental disorders was 17.8% and of probable PTSD was 2.8%. Perceived home difficulties significantly influenced the mental health of deployed personnel; the greater the perception of negative events in the home environment, the greater the reporting of adverse mental health effects. This finding was independent of combat exposure and was only partially mitigated by being well led and reporting subjectively good unit cohesion; however, the effect of the totality of home-front events was not improved by the latter. Poor perceived military support for the family had a detrimental impact on deployment mental health. Conclusions The armed forces offer many support services to the partners and families of deployed personnel and ensuring that the efforts being made on their behalf are well communicated might improve the mental health of deployed personnel.",

The participants were 71 male and female high school athletes on 20 track relay teams. Before a selected competition, participants completed a collective efficacy questionnaire. Then, immediately after their race, they were administered a modified version of the revised Causal Dimension Scale-II. A multi-level framework was employed to assess collective efficacy as an individually held perception and as a shared team belief. The individual perceptions of team success/failure significantly predicted the locus of causality and stability dimensions, whereas aggregated collective efficacy emerged as a significant team level predictor of average stability. Individual perceptions of collective efficacy were significantly related to team control and this relationship was moderated by the sex of the team. The findings indicate that collective efficacy beliefs held by athletes and teams prior to a competition influence the formation of post-competition team attributions in sport.",

Prevalence rates of IPV range from 17% to 39% for female service members, and 21.9% to 74% for veterans. Most service members and veterans indicated using the Internet at least occasionally and expressed willingness to seek information about services via the Internet. Informed by data, we conducted a systematic review of military (Army, Navy, Air Force, and Marine Corps) and non-military (Veterans Affairs and Google) websites to explore the availability and presentation of information and resources related to IPV. The websites search revealed a variety of resources and information available, and important differences between sites with regard to what and how information is presented.

As increased numbers of military Service members have children, it is critical to understand the association between military deployment and child adjustment. In order to resolve inconsistencies in the existing literature, we performed a meta-analytic review of 16 studies that report associations of military deployment with internalizing, externalizing, and academic adjustment among children. Results indicate a small association between deployment and poorer adjustment. This association varied across several features of the studies. Age moderation was such that the associations are strongest in middle childhood and weakest during adolescence. The method that adjustment was assessed also moderated this association, such that maladjustment was evident primarily with parents' reports. Study design also moderated associations, such that comparisons to civilian controls indicated associations with maladjustment, whereas comparisons to nondeployed military and prepost comparisons did not. These findings summarize the existing quantitative literature to indicate that parental deployment has a negligible association with child maladjustment and provide a foundation for future research.",

        "paperAbstract": "Background Risk factors of violence perpetration in veterans include substance use and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD); however, it is unknown whether these factors are associated with greater risk for partner or non-partner violence. This study investigated the associations between probable PTSD, heavy drinking, marijuana use, cocaine use, and partner and non-partner violence perpetration. Methods Self-report questionnaires assessing past-year partner and non-partner aggression (CTS2) as well as past-month substance use (SAOM), probable PTSD (PCL-C), and probable depression (PHQ-9) were administered to 810 substance using veterans entering VA mental health treatment. Results In bivariate analyses, probable PTSD in substance using veterans was associated with violence perpetration (partner physical, \u03c72=11.46, p=0.001, \u03c6=0.12; non-partner physical, \u03c72=50.64, p<0.001, \u03c6=0.25; partner injury, \u03c72=6.41, p=0.011, \u03c6=0.09; non-partner injury, \u03c72=42.71, p<0.001, \u03c6=0.23). In multiple logistic regression analyses that adjusted for sociodemographic characteristics, probable PTSD was independently associated with non-partner physical (odds ratio [OR], 2.82; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.97\u20134.05) and injury aggression (OR, 3.96; CI, 2.56\u20136.13). Cocaine and heavy drinking were independently associated with non-partner physical and injury aggression and non-partner injury aggression respectively. Conclusions The results provide evidence that probable PTSD, heavy drinking, and cocaine use are associated with increased risk of non-partner violence perpetration in substance using veterans. These results underscore the importance of screening for PTSD symptoms and violence perpetration towards non-partners in substance using veterans presenting for treatment.",

        "paperAbstract": "There is growing support for the efficacy of mindfulness training with parents as an intervention technique to improve parenting skills and reduce risk for youth problem behaviors. The evidence, however, has been limited to small scale studies, many with methodological shortcomings. This study sought to integrate mindfulness training with parents into the Strengthening Families Program: For Parents and Youth 10\u201314 (SFP 10\u201314), an empirically-validated family-based preventive intervention. It used a randomized-controlled comparative effectiveness study design (N = 432 families, 31% racial/ethnic minority) to test the efficacy of the Mindfulness-Enhanced Strengthening Families Program (MSFP), compared to standard SFP 10\u201314 and a minimal-treatment home study control condition. Results indicated that, in general, MSFP was as effective as SFP 10\u201314 in improving multiple dimensions of parenting, including interpersonal mindfulness in parenting, parent\u2013youth relationship quality, youth behavior management, and parent well-being, according to both parent and youth reports at both postintervention and 1-year follow-up. This study also found that in some areas MSFP boosted and better sustained the effects of SFP 10\u201314, especially for fathers. Although the pattern of effects was not as uniform as hypothesized, this study provides intriguing evidence for the unique contribution of mindfulness activities to standard parent training.

Upon reintegration, these soldiers often face a number of stressors related to their combat zone experiences and readjustment to civilian life. One of these stressors is the reintegration with family, partners, and children. This qualitative study involved interviews with 30 women from the National Guard regarding their reintegration experiences with their children. Four categories were revealed from the data: (a) Concerns for Children\u2019s Well-being, (b) Sense of Loss (c) Reintegration: Personal Challenges, and (d) Reintegration: Children\u2019s Reactions. Implications for clinical work with returning soldiers and further research are discussed.",

The current study extends understanding of the hazardous alcohol use-IPV link by examining what factors moderate this association in a more systematic and broader way that has been done in past studies. Individual, family, workplace, community, and developmental factors were tested as moderators of the hazardous alcohol use and IPV link in a large, representative sample of active duty service members (the 2006 Community Assessment), and the results were tested for replicability in a hold-out sample. Two family variables (relationship satisfaction and parent\u2013child satisfaction), 1 community variable (community safety), and 3 developmental variables (years in the military, marital length, and family income/pay grade) cross-validated as significant moderators of the association between men's hazardous alcohol use and IPV. Across the significant moderators, the association between hazardous alcohol use and men's IPV was weakened by maturation/development, improved community safety, and better relationship functioning. No individual or workplace variables were significant moderators for men, and there were no significant moderators found for women. The results support the importance of a developmental and relational perspective to understanding the hazardous alcohol use-IPV link, rather than solely an individual coping perspective.

We examined the association of military service history with past-year suicidal ideation and past-30-days mental distress in a probability-based sample of adults. Methods. We gathered 2010 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System data from 5 states that asked about past-year suicidal ideation. Military service was de\ufb01ned as current or former active-duty service or National Guard or Reserves service. We strati\ufb01ed analyses into 18 to 39 years, 40 to 64 years, and 65 years and older age groups and used multiple logistic regression analyses, adjusted for demographic confounders, to discern the association of military service history with past-year suicidal ideation and past-30-days mental distress. Results. Among the 26 736 respondents, 13.1% indicated military service history. After adjusting for several confounders, we found military history status among those aged 40 to 64 years was associated with both past-year suicidal ideation and past-30-days mental distress. We found no signi\ufb01cant associations among the younger or older age groups. Conclusions. Differences in suicidal ideation between military and nonmilitary individuals may occur in midlife. Future research should examine the possibility of cohort effects, service era effects, or both. (Am J Public Health. 2014;104: S595\u2013S602. doi:10.2105/AJPH.2014.302064)",

It is important to understand factors that contribute to reintegration stress since reintegration stress can affect their own and their family\u2019s emotional health and well-being for months if not years into the future. This study addresses the factors that contribute to more positive outcomes and reduced reintegration stress, for reintegrating military families. Service members and partners who report the presence of PTSD related symptoms and report their own and their partner\u2019s mental health as low, are more likely to experience more reintegration stress. The results indicate that this model is able to significantly predict variance (32 and 37 %, respectively) in reintegration stress levels. It is important for mental health providers to understand the variation in reintegrating families\u2019 stress levels and coping skills. Employing a systemic approach uniquely positions therapists to more effectively address these issues to help military families develop healthy cohesive family systems.",

Taken together, they compellingly make the case for family-centered care approaches and interventions. They also emphasize the need for families to understand and make meaning together of the experiences they have undergone and that this is a long-term, ongoing, dynamic, and interactive process.",

We estimate effects of payday loan access on enlisted personnel using exogenous variation in Air Force rules assigning personnel to bases across the United States, and within-state variation in lending laws over time. Airmen job performance and retention declines with payday loan access, and severely poor readiness increases. These effects are strongest among relatively inexperienced and financially unsophisticated airmen.",

Main Exposure Parental deployment.\nOutcome Measures: Mean externalizing, internalizing, and total symptom scores on the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) (1(1/2)-5 years) and the CBCL-Teacher Report Form (TRF) (1(1/2)-5 years).\nResults: One hundred sixty-nine of 233 consenting families (73%) participated.

Parents with children aged 3 years or older and a deployed spouse had significantly higher depression scores than those without a deployed spouse. There were no differences in the demographic characteristics between groups. After controlling for respondent's age, stress and depressive symptoms, deployed service member's rank, and total number of children in the home, we found an age by deployment interaction: children aged 3 years or older with a deployed parent had significantly higher CBCL externalizing and total scores (externalizing, 48.50 vs 43.31, P < .05; total, 47.71 vs 42.68, P < .05) and externalizing and total TRF scores (externalizing, 50.21 vs 45.62, P < .05; total, 48.54 vs 43.73, P < .05) compared with same-aged peers without a deployed parent.\nConclusions: This study is the first to show that children aged 3 years or older with a deployed parent exhibit increased behavioral symptoms compared with peers without a deployed parent after controlling for caregiver's stress and depressive symptoms.",

Our focus is on African American mothers among whom breastfeeding rates are lowest. The military context may mitigate conditions associated with low breastfeeding prevalence by (a) providing stable employment and educational opportunities to populations who face an otherwise poor labor market and (b) providing universal healthcare that includes breastfeeding consultation. Using pregnancy risk assessment monitoring system (PRAMS) data for which we received special permission from each state to flag military affiliation, we analyze civilians and military affiliate in breastfeeding initiation using logistic regression and breastfeeding duration using Cox proportional hazard analysis. We find that breastfeeding is more prevalent among all women in the military setting and that the black\u2013white gap in breastfeeding duration common among civilians is significantly reduced among military affiliates. Breastfeeding is a crucial component of maternal and child health and eliminating racial disparities in its prevalence is a public health priority. This study is the first to identify the military as an important institutional context that deserves closer examination to glean potential policy implications for civilian society.",

The study being exploratory in nature, focus group was chosen for data collection. Three focus groups were held with boys and girls in the age group 12\u201318 years who were experiencing the deployment of their father for more than six months. Each group consisted of 6\u20138 participants. A semi structured interview schedule was prepared for the focus group interviews. Each focus group was audio taped and then transcribed for further analysis. Response themes indicate relocation in the absence of the father, changes in roles and responsibilities, routine changes, not having the parent to help with the homework, participate in activities and provide guidance as major sources of stress. While the relaxation in family rules and discipline is cherished by all, there are reintegration problems when the parent returns. Some adolescents expressed concern about the health and worries of the at-home parent, for most of them the mother or the at home parent is the central figure who helps steer through the multiple deployments.",

The results show the importance and independence of sex-role attitude congruency as an explanatory variable in marital research. Although it was predicted that Ss with congruent sex-role attitudes would report higher marital quality than Ss with incongruent sex-role attitudes, this prediction was only partially supported. The marriages found to have the lowest evaluation of marital quality were those with a traditional husband and a modern wife. The results are discussed in the context of past research that failed to find a significant relationship between sex-role attitudes and marital quality.",

Methods: We used data from the Department of Defense Health-Related Behaviors surveys, which collect comprehensive, population-based data for reserve and active-duty forces. Data were collected from 18342 reservists and 16146 active-duty personnel. Results: Overall, with adjustment for sociodemographic and service differences, reservists reported similar or less work and family stress, depression, and anxiety symptoms than did active-duty personnel. However, reservists who had been deployed reported higher rates of suicidal ideation and attempts than did active-duty personnel who had been deployed and higher rates of posttraumatic stress disorder symptomatology than did any active-duty personnel and reservists who had not been deployed. The highest rates of suicidal ideation and attempts were among reservists who had served in theaters other than Iraq and Afghanistan. Conclusions: Our results suggest that deployment has a greater impact on reservists than on active-duty members, thus highlighting the urgent need for services addressing reservists\u2019 unique postdeployment mental health issues. Also, deployment to any theater, not only Iraq or Afghanistan, represents unique threats to all service members\u2019 mental well-being. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)",

Design Randomized controlled trial with repeated measures. Setting Large military community in Texas. Participants Pregnant women (N\u00a0= 246) in a military sample defined as active duty or spouse of military personnel. Methods Participants were randomized in the first trimester to the MOMS program or normal prenatal care. Participants attended eight 1-hour sessions every other week during the first, second, and third trimesters of pregnancy. Pregnancy-specific anxiety, depression, self-esteem, and resilience were measured in each trimester. Linear mixed models were used to compare the two-group difference in slope for prenatal anxiety, depression, self-esteem, and resilience. Results The Prenatal Self-Evaluation Questionnaire was used to measure perinatal anxiety. Rates of prenatal anxiety on the Identification With a Motherhood Role (p\u00a0= .049) scale and the Preparation for Labor (p\u00a0= .017) scale were significantly reduced for participants in MOMS. Nulliparous participants showed significantly lower anxiety on the Acceptance of Pregnancy scale and significantly greater anxiety on the Preparation for Labor scale. Single participants had significantly greater anxiety on the Well-Being of Self and Baby in Labor scale, and participants with deployed husbands had significantly greater anxiety on the Identification With a Motherhood Role scale. Conclusion Participation in the MOMS program reduced pregnancy-specific prenatal anxiety for the dimensions of Identification With a Motherhood Role and Preparation for Labor. Both dimensions of anxiety were previously found to be significantly associated with preterm birth and low birth weight.

Self-reports from both husbands and wives regarding relationship functioning did not differ between couples who were and were not separated due to deployment in the prior year. However, deployment in the past year was related to higher levels of current PTSD symptoms for husbands, and husbands' current PTSD symptoms were associated with lower marital satisfaction, confidence in the relationship, positive bonding between the spouses, parenting alliance, and dedication to the relationship for both husbands and wives. In addition, husbands' current PTSD symptoms were associated with higher levels of negative communication for both husbands and wives, and lower satisfaction with sacrifice for the relationship for husbands. Once positive bonding, negative communication, and parenting alliance were controlled, husband PTSD symptoms no longer significantly predicted marital satisfaction for wives. Husband PTSD symptoms continued to exert a significant, but reduced, unique effect on husband marital satisfaction once these variables were accounted for. The results provide greater understanding of the relationship of deployment/PTSD symptoms and marital functioning and suggest areas for intervention with military couples.",

Based on the principles of positive psychology, CSF is a historically unique approach to behavioral health in a large (1.1 million members) organization. There are four program elements: (a) the assessment of emotional, social, family, and spiritual fitness; (b) individualized learning modules to improve fitness in these domains; (c) formal resilience training; and (d) training of Army master resilience trainers (MRTs) to instill better thinking skills and resilience in their subordinates. In contrast to traditional approaches, CSF is proactive; rather than waiting to see who has a negative outcome following stress, it provides ways of improving resilience for all members of the Army. CSF aims to move the full spectrum of responses to trauma and adversity-ranging from stress-related disorders to ordinary resilience-toward personal growth. This program may provide a model for implementing similar interventions in other very large institutions.",

Substance use predisposes youth to myriad health and social problems across the life span. Purpose This study examined the prevalence and correlates of lifetime and recent substance use in a normative sample of youth who were either connected or not connected to the military. Methods Data are from a subsample of the 2011 California Healthy Kids Survey (N=14,149). Items in the present analyses included present familial military affiliation (no one, parent, sibling); number of deployments (none, one, two or more); gender; grade; and race/ethnicity. Substance use items assessed whether the youth reported lifetime use of alcohol, tobacco, marijuana, other drugs, or prescription drugs; and recent (past 30 days) use of alcohol, tobacco, marijuana, and other drugs. Results Multivariate analysis conducted in 2012 revealed that an increase in the number of deployments was associated with a higher likelihood of lifetime and recent use, with the exception of lifetime smoking. Conclusions These results indicate that experiences associated with deployment of a family member may increase the likelihood of substance use.",

        "paperAbstract": "The global war on terror has placed a number of stressful demands on service members and their families. Although the military offers a wide range of services and supports to military families, not all families are willing or able to use them. For example, geographically dispersed families can find it challenging to connect with military support resources. School liaison programs (SLPs) were developed by the military to foster the development of local partnerships to enhance the academic success of military children. In this study, all 20 Marine Corps school liaisons (SLs) reported on the frequency and severity of stressors experienced by Marine families. We hypothesized that SLs would encounter families contending with a broad array of challenges, well beyond those related to academics. Indeed, SLs reported that military families sought assistance for a wide array of stressors. School transition stressors were most common for children and youth, while deployment-related stress was most common for Marine families. Despite the limitations of this study, the results suggest that families using the Marine SLPs may be a vulnerable group. Military\u2013school\u2013community partnerships may hold out promise for filling in service gaps faced by those military families experiencing high levels of stressor exposure and low levels of coping resources.",

However, because reservists and their families are unaccustomed to deployments, many families may experience boundary ambiguity, a state in which family members are uncertain in their perception about who is in or out of the family and who is performing which roles and tasks within the family. This qualitative description study examined boundary ambiguity in military reserve families over time. A sample of 34 reservists, spouses, and parents was interviewed 7 times within the 1st year of the reservists' return from Iraq. During deployment, all family members experienced boundary ambiguity. Gathering information and attending a family support group provided some relief for families. After the reservists returned, couples as well as those who had experienced additional life events or losses experienced the highest levels of boundary ambiguity. However, this boundary ambiguity dissipated over time, as families tended to restabilize once the reservists had returned to work and a routine had been established.

        "paperAbstract": "Since the advent of the all-volunteer force in the 1970s, marriage, parenthood, and family life have become commonplace in the U.S. military among enlisted personnel and officers alike, and military spouses and children now outnumber service members by a ratio of 1.4 to 1. Reviewing data from the government and from academic and nonacademic research, Molly Clever and David R. Segal find several trends that distinguish today's military families. Compared with civilians, for example, service members marry younger and start families earlier. Because of the requirements of their jobs, they move much more frequently than civilians do, and they are often separated from their families for months at a time. And despite steady increases since the 1970s in the percentage of women who serve, the armed forces are still overwhelmingly male, meaning that the majority of military parents are fathers. Despite these distinguishing trends, Clever and Segal's chief finding is that military families cannot be neatly pigeonholed. Instead, they are a strikingly diverse population with diverse needs. Within the military, demographic groups differ in important ways, and the service branches differ from one another as well. Military families themselves come in many forms, including not only the categories familiar from civilian life--two-parent, single-parent, and so on--but also, unique to the military, dual-service families in which both parents are service members. Moreover, military families' needs change over time as they move through personal and military transitions. Thus the best policies and programs to help military families and children are flexible and adaptable rather than rigidly structured.",

The purpose of this study was to determine if deployment of 6 months to Bosnia predicted early postdeployment domestic violence. Active duty recently deployed (N = 313; mean age 28.18 yrs) and nondeployed (N = 712; mean age 28.55 yrs) male soldiers volunteered to take an anonymous questionnaire (Conflict Tactics Scale). Deployment was not a significant predictor of postdeployment domestic violence. However, younger soldiers, those with predeployment domestic violence, nonwhite race, and off-post residence also were more likely to report postdeployment domestic violence. The predicted probability of postdeployment domestic violence for a deployed 20-year-old, nonwhite soldier with a history of predeployment domestic violence and who lives on-post was .20. For the soldier without a history of predeployment domestic violence, it was .05. Prevention and intervention programs for postdeployment domestic violence shortly after return should target age and persons with a domestic violence history rather than deployment per se.

The current study employed 11 focus groups with military youth, parents, and school personnel working with military youth to better understand how youth and their families cope with stressors faced as result of living in a military family. An inductive approach was used for data analysis, where two coders and the lead author coded the transcripts until saturation was achieved. Matrices and data display models were developed to make comparisons across participant groups. Findings revealed that military youth are most worried about making frequent moves and having a parent deployed. However, youth and their parents who had better social connections to each other, their peers, and their neighborhoods appeared to make better adjustments to these challenges. School personnel reported that more military families needed to become aware of the services offered to help families cope effectively. Implications for future research and intervention programs for military youth and their families are discussed.",

Method: The study was conducted across a metropolitan mental health service in Sydney, Australia. Patients (n = 407) and carers (n = 50) completed the Camberwell Assessment of Need Short Appraisal Schedule. Carers also completed a shortened version of the Involvement Evaluation Questionnaire to assess caregiver burden. Results: When completing the assessment tools, patients and carers in hospital settings were asked to consider the 4 weeks preceding hospitalisation; in the community, patients and carers were asked to consider the previous 4 weeks. These data show a high percentage of patients in hospital and community settings have unmet needs for company, daytime activities and intimate relationships. Inpatients had more unmet needs than community based patients. Agreement between patients' and carers ratings' of need ranged from 'poor' to 'moderate'. There was a strong relationship between unmet need and burden from the carer's perspective. Patients with and without carers had similar numbers of needs. Carers of patients recently admitted to hospital reported a significantly higher burden. Conclusions: Carers of inpatients experienced significantly more burden than carers of outpatients. Opportunities to access support, information and education should be readily available and not contingent upon demonstrating a close familial relationship to the patient. We found that unmet need was significantly related to burden, suggesting that meeting patient needs could reduce carer burden.",

The objectives of this study were to determine whether military deployment, combat exposures, and mental health conditions were related to risk of newly-reported diabetes over 3-years. Research Design and Methods: Data were from Millennium Cohort Study participants who completed baseline (July 2001\u2013June 2003) and follow-up (June 2004\u2013February 2006) questionnaires (follow-up response rate = 71\u00b74%). After applying exclusion criteria, adjusted analyses included 44,754 participants (median age 36 years, range 18\u201368). Survey instruments collected demographics, height, weight, lifestyle, military service, clinician-diagnosed diabetes, and other physical and mental health conditions. Deployment was defined by US Department of Defense databases, while combat exposure was assessed by self-report at follow-up. Odds of newly-reported diabetes were estimated using logistic regression analysis. Results: Occurrence of diabetes during follow-up was 3/1000 person-years. Persons reporting diabetes at follow-up were significantly older, had greater baseline body mass index (BMI) and were less likely to be Caucasian. After adjusting for age, sex, BMI, education, race/ethnicity, military service characteristics, and mental health conditions, only baseline posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) was significantly associated with risk of diabetes (odds ratio 2\u00b707, 95% confidence interval 1\u00b731\u20133\u00b729). Deployments since September 2001 were not significantly related to higher diabetes risk, with or without combat exposure. Conclusions: In this military cohort, PTSD symptoms at baseline, but not other mental health symptoms or military deployment experience, were significantly associated with future risk of self-reported diabetes.",

        "paperAbstract": "Children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) utilize a greater number of healthcare services compared to children with other developmental disabilities. Despite this, children with ASD remain at high risk for unmet service needs, which are compounded by differences in socioeconomic status (SES). Both empowerment and parent-professional partnership play a role in service outcomes and may be especially important in understanding these service disparities. Our goal was to better understand the contributions of these variables to service disparities in families of children with ASD. Two-hundred forty-nine parents of children with ASD between the ages of 3 and 20 participated in this online survey. Results support previous research highlighting high levels of unmet needs that are exacerbated by differences in parent education, a common indicator of SES. Empowerment and parent-professional partnership also predicted service delivery outcomes. While high quality partnership predicted greater service adequacy, empowerment was inversely related to services. Furthermore, an interaction found that highly empowered families experiencing poor quality partnerships reported worse service delivery outcomes, while empowerment was not a factor in services for families experiencing high quality partnerships. Parent-professional partnership partially mediated the relationship between parent education and service delivery outcomes. As such, increasing parent-professional partnerships through family-centered care and professional training may help to reduce education-related service disparities and improve satisfaction with care for families and children with ASD.",

The discharge type not only affects eligibility for benefits, but is associated with negative downstream consequences (e.g., homelessness, criminal justice involvement). However, limited empirical research has examined the mental health and substance use-related needs of veterans who were not Honorably discharged, and the few that have only focus on veterans who received punitive discharges. This study addressed gaps in the research literature on discharge status by examining differences in mental health, substance use, and attitudes toward psychological treatment among veterans who received Honorable, General Under Honorable Conditions, and Other Than Honorable (OTH) discharges. Young adult veterans (N = 734) were recruited online and completed a battery of self-report measures. Results indicated that veterans who received General and OTH discharges endorsed significantly greater rates of mental health conditions and substance misuse. They also reported more negative perceptions of mental health care. Because these veterans may also experience more barriers to accessing mental health services, it is critical to consider ways to connect these veterans with needed services.",

Aims This study addressed these limitations using a population-based, prospective cohort of US military personnel deployed in support of the operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. Method The sample consisted of US military service members in all branches including active duty, reserve and national guard who deployed once (n = 3393) or multiple times (n = 4394). Self-reported symptoms of post-traumatic stress were obtained prior to deployment and at two follow-ups spaced 3 years apart. Data were examined for longitudinal trajectories using latent growth mixture modelling. Results Each analysis revealed remarkably similar post-traumatic stress trajectories across time. The most common pattern was low\u2013stable post-traumatic stress or resilience (83.1% single deployers, 84.9% multiple deployers), moderate\u2013improving (8.0%, 8.5%), then worsening\u2013chronic posttraumatic stress (6.7%, 4.5%), high\u2013stable (2.2% single deployers only) and high\u2013improving (2.2% multiple deployers only). Covariates associated with each trajectory were identified. Conclusions The final models exhibited similar types of trajectories for single and multiple deployers; most notably, the stable trajectory of low post-traumatic stress pre- to post-deployment, or resilience, was exceptionally high. Several factors predicting trajectories were identified, which we hope will assist in future research aimed at decreasing the risk of post-traumatic stress disorder among deployers.",

Methods: We computed the PDHRA\u2019s sensitivity and specificity for depression and PTSD and developed a structural model to suggest possible improvements to it. Results: For depression, sensitivity and specificity were 0.704 and 0.651, respectively; for PTSD, they were 0.774 and 0.650, respectively. Several variables produced significant direct effects on depression and trauma, suggesting that modifications could increase its sensitivity and specificity. Conclusions: The PDHRA was moderately effective in identifying airmen with depression and PTSD. It identified behavioral health concerns in many airmen who did not develop a diagnostic mental health condition. Its low level of specificity may result in reduced barriers to care and increased support services, key components of a public health approach to suicide prevention, for airmen experiencing subacute levels of distress after deployment, which may, in part, account for lower suicide rates among airmen after deployment.

        "paperAbstract": "OBJECTIVE: Military personnel returning from Iraq and Afghanistan with traumatic brain injury (TBI) present with a complex array of stressors encountered during combat as well as upon re-entry, often with additional physical and mental health comorbidities. This requires an intensive approach to treatment that includes family intervention as a part of rehabilitation. There is a small but growing literature addressing the needs of families when a family member has sustained a TBI. An established treatment intervention for individuals with serious mental illness, such as family focused therapy (FFT), is uniquely suited to address the complexity of issues presented by returning military personnel, and may be adapted for moderate to severe TBI populations. In this article, we discuss the rationale for adapting this family intervention for this population and present a case vignette illustrating adaptations for TBI. CONCLUSIONS: The adaptation of an existing family intervention for a chronic condition that focuses on enhancing both individual and family functioning is a useful starting point. With further research to modify FFT for this unique population and establish feasibility, this approach may supplement existing models of family intervention.",

We surveyed 100 individuals who were part of 50 couples who had recently entered the empty-nest phase of their relationship to identify themes of relationship change (RQ1), relational uncertainty (RQ2), and interference from partners (RQ3) during the empty-nest transition. Results revealed five themes of relationship change: (a) increased couple time, (b) reduced structure provides increased freedom, (c) increased communication, (d) increased privacy, and (e) new beginnings. Four themes of relational uncertainty were identified: (a) new roles and identities, (b) dependency anxiety, (c) love and intimacy, and (d) growing older. Four themes of partner interference were also found: (a) relationship facilitation, (b) guilt, (c) forced activity, and (d) household chores. Our findings suggest that the relational turbulence model may be a useful tool for understanding the relationship challenges faced by couples during late-life transitions.",

This article presents preliminary program evaluation data for Stage I and Stage II of the iRelate program, with additional data from Marines that are engaged to be married and Marines that were in the process of getting divorced. Results showed, prior to attending Stage I and Stage II of the program, Marines presented with high levels of marriage idealism and overconfidence. Twenty-nine percent stated, because they are Marines, they are capable of taking on adult responsibilities and 32.4 % believed that marriage would require some effort. Of the Marines that were in the process of getting divorced, 40 % indicated that they were too young to be married, 50 % stated if they could do it over again they would have taken more time to get to know their spouse prior to getting married. The post course data indicated that the Marines\u2019 level of idealism and overconfidence decreased, as 63.2 % of the Marines developed a more realistic expectation of marriage, by realizing that marriage will require a lot of hard work. Additionally, Marines felt more prepared for their marriage [t(177) = 7.62, p < 0.001, r\u00b2 = 0.25] suggesting that the program offers a significant benefit to the Marines.

Using qualitative and quantitative data collected from the Belize Defense Force (BDF), we employed a grounded theoretical framework and the Bourdieusian concept of the field and habitus to clarify how the military occupation is implicated in structuring aspects of sexual risk behaviors among personnel. We focus results on in-depth qualitative interviews conducted with 15 male-identified BDF personnel. We identify and describe how two field elements, namely operational tempo and ongoing exposure to occupational hazards, are occupationally specific field elements implicated in the production of sexual risk behavior through the mediating matrix of the military class habitus. Our findings demonstrate a conceptual clarity regarding the institutional field and habitus through which military personnel make sense of and act on the risk of bodily harm with regard to their own sexual behaviors. We conclude by outlining our theoretical concept so that it can be directly applied in public health efforts in order to leverage military occupational field elements for the purpose of HIV and STI prevention.",

DESIGN: Systematic review of the published, peer-reviewed literature. PRIMARY MEASURES: Not applicable. RESULTS: We identified 75 studies that examined the relations between TBI and neurologic outcomes. Unprovoked seizures are causally related to penetrating TBI as well as to moderate and severe TBI. There was only limited evidence of an association between seizures and mild TBI. Dementia of the Alzheimer's type (DAT) was associated with moderate and severe TBI, but not with mild TBI unless there was loss of consciousness (LOC); the evidence for the latter was limited. Parkinsonism was associated with moderate and severe TBI, but there was only modest evidence of a link with mild TBI without LOC. Dementia pugilistica was associated with professional boxing. There was insufficient evidence to support an association between TBI and both multiple sclerosis and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. TBI appeared to produce a host of postconcussive symptoms (eg, memory problems, dizziness, and irritability). Moderate and severe TBI were associated with endocrine problems such as hypopituitarism and growth hormone deficiency and possibly with diabetes insipidus. There was only limited evidence of an association between mild TBI and the development of ocular/visual motor deterioration. CONCLUSION: TBI is strongly associated with several neurologic disorders 6 months or more after injury. Clinicians caring for TBI patients should monitor them closely for the development of these disorders. While some of these disorders can be treated after they arise (eg, seizures), a greater public health benefit would be achieved by preventing them before they develop. Research efforts to develop therapies aimed at secondary prevention are currently underway.",

We reviewed empirical studies and used two case studies to illustrate the potential explanatory role of Joiner's (2005) interpersonal-psychological theory of suicidal behavior. The theory posits that three variables--perceived burdensomeness, thwarted belongingness, and acquired capability for suicide--determine the risk of an individual engaging in a lethal suicide attempt. In our case studies, we illustrate how these variables might be affected in an active duty population post-deployment. Although methodological limitations preclude conclusive determinations, the case studies provide a framework within which to understand the phenomenon of suicide in the military. Future work that examines these findings empirically will be invaluable to both researchers and mental health counselors. [paperAbstract FROM AUTHOR]",

This study aimed to examine the prevalence and psychosocial correlates of suicide attempts among psychiatrically hospitalized adolescent offspring of Croatian male PTSD veterans. Participants were psychiatric inpatients, ages 12\u201318 years. Self-report questionnaires assessed demographics, suicide attempts, psychopathology, parenting style, and family functioning. The prevalence of suicide attempts was 61.5 % (65.2 % for girls and 58.0 % for boys). Internalizing symptoms, family dysfunction, lower levels of maternal and paternal care, and paternal overcontrol were significantly associated with suicide attempts. Our findings suggest that suicide attempts are common among inpatient adolescent offspring of male PTSD veterans and that interventions targeting both adolescent psychopathology and family relationships are needed for adolescents who have attempted suicide.",

Furthermore, little is known about whether risk factors for suicidal behaviors in civilian populations are generalizable to soldiers. The aim of the current study is to determine whether the prevalence and correlates of past-year suicidal ideation and suicide attempts differ in Canadian soldiers when compared with Canadian civilians. The current study utilized data from the Canadian Community Health Survey Cycle 1.2-Canadian Forces Supplement in conjunction with the 2001-2002 Canadian Community Health Survey Cycle 1.2. Logistic regression interaction models were used to explore differences between correlates of suicidal ideation and suicide attempts comparing Canadian soldiers with civilians. Although there was no significant difference between the 2 samples on prevalence of past-year suicidal ideation, the prevalence of past-year suicide attempts was significantly lower in the Canadian forces sample compared with the civilian population (odds ratio = 0.41, 95% confidence interval: 0.25, 0.67). Findings suggest that suicide attempts are less common in Canadian active military personnel than in the civilian population. Possible mechanisms for these differences are discussed.",

In Study 2, 118 military couples reported on topic avoidance for the first 3 months after homecoming. Multilevel modeling results revealed that the generalized anxiety and relational uncertainty of actors, but not partners, were consistent predictors of topic avoidance.

Design Observational and cross-sectional study. Setting Data from the USA 2010 Iowa Youth Survey, a statewide survey of 6th, 8th and 11th graders, were analyzed during 2011. Participants Of all 6th-, 8th- and 11th-grade students enrolled in Iowa in 2010, 69% (n = 78 240) completed the survey. Measurements Ever drink more than a few sips of alcohol and past 30-day: binge drinking, marijuana consumption, other illegal drug use and prescription drug misuse. Findings The rates of alcohol use [risk difference (RD) = 7.85, 99.91% confidence interval (CI) = 4.44\u201311.26], binge drinking (RD = 8.02, 99.91% CI = 4.91\u201311.13), marijuana use (RD = 5.30, 99.91% CI = 2.83\u20137.77), other illegal drug use (RD = 7.10, 99.91% CI = 4.63\u20139.56) and prescription drug misuse (RD = 8.58, 99.91% CI = 5.64\u201311.51) are greater for children of currently or recently deployed parents than for children of parents who are not in the military. The magnitude of the effects is consistent across 6th, 8th and 11th grades. Disrupted living arrangements further accentuate increased substance use, with the largest effect seen in children with a deployed parent who was not living with a parent or relative. Conclusions Children of deployed military personnel should be considered at higher risk for substance use than children of non-military citizens.",

This study seeks to determine the extent to which spirituality is associated with selected mental health problems among active duty military personnel and whether it moderates the relationship between combat exposure/deployment and (a) depression, (b) posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and (c) suicidality in active duty military personnel. Data were drawn from the 2008 Department of Defense Survey of Health Related Behaviors Among Active Duty Military Personnel. Over 24,000 randomly selected active duty personnel worldwide completed an anonymous self-report questionnaire. High spirituality had a significant protective effect only for depression symptoms. Medium, as opposed to high or low, levels of spirituality buffered each of the mental health outcomes to some degree. Medium and low spirituality levels predicted depression symptoms but only among those with moderate combat exposure. Medium spirituality levels also predicted PTSD symptoms among those with moderate levels of combat exposure and predicted self-reported suicidal ideation/attempt among those never deployed. These results point to the complex relationship between spirituality and mental health, particularly among military personnel and the need for further research.",

Methods: We linked outpatient health care claims data for military service members' children <2 years of age from fiscal year 2007 to the parental deployment history during the same period. Incidence rate ratios (IRRs) for all visits and well-child visits were determined according to parental deployment status. Results: A total of 169986 children were identified, with 1772703 outpatient visits. Of those children, 32% had a parent deployed during the study period. Well-child visits constituted 27% of all outpatient visits. The unadjusted visit rates for all visits and well-child visits were 10.4 and 2.8 visits per year, respectively. Children of single parents had decreased rates of outpatient visits (IRR: 0.84 [95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.80\u20130.89]; P < .001) and well-child visits (IRR: 0.88 [95% CI: 0.84\u20130.93]; P < .001) during deployment. Children of married parents, however, had increased rates of both outpatient visits (IRR: 1.08 [95% CI: 1.03\u20131.09]; P < .001) and well-child visits (IRR: 1.08 [95% CI: 1.07\u20131.09]; P < .001) during deployment. There was interaction between parental marital status and deployment, which was most significant among parents <24 years of age and consistently decreased with increasing parental age. Conclusions: Children of young, single, military parents are seen less frequently for acute and well-child care when their parent is deployed, whereas children of married parents are seen more frequently in the military health system.",

        "paperAbstract": "There are a growing number of studies that have approximated levels of aggression and associated outcomes among combat veterans returning from Iraq and Afghanistan using brief screening assessments. However, further research to evaluate the relative role of combat exposures and overt physical behaviors is required to further elucidate potential associations between military service, combat deployment, and overt physical aggression. The purpose of the current study was to assess the prevalence of self-reported physical aggression in a sample of US Army soldiers using an adaptation of the Revised Conflict Tactics Scale (CTS2), and examine factors associated with higher levels of aggression. A population-based cross-sectional study was conducted at a single US Army Installation within a sample of active duty US Army soldiers (n = 6,128) from two large units. Anonymous surveys were collected 6 months following deployment to measure overt aggressive behaviors, posttraumatic stress disorder, anxiety, depression, traumatic brain injury, and misuse of alcohol. There were a relatively higher number of minor and severe physical overt aggressive actions reported among soldiers who previously deployed, notably highest among deployed soldiers reporting the highest levels of combat intensity. Soldiers screening positive for the misuse of alcohol were also significantly more likely to report relatively higher levels of physical aggression. This study quantified overt aggressive behaviors and associated factors, showing increasing combat exposures may result in increased physical aggression. Clinicians treating service members returning from combat may consider assessing relative levels of combat. Aggr. Behav. 38:357-367, 2012. Published 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.\u2020",

We used cross-sectional data from the 2008 Washington State Healthy Youth Survey collected in public school grades 8, 10, and 12 (n = 10 606). We conducted multivariable logistic regression analyses to test associations between parental military service and adolescent well-being (quality of life, depressed mood, thoughts of suicide)., Results. In 8th grade, parental deployment was associated with higher odds of reporting thoughts of suicide among adolescent girls (odds ratio [OR] = 1.66; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.19, 2.32) and higher odds of low quality of life (OR = 2.10; 95% CI = 1.43, 3.10) and thoughts of suicide (OR = 1.75; 95% CI = 1.15, 2.67) among adolescent boys. In 10th and 12th grades, parental deployment was associated with higher odds of reporting low quality of life (OR = 2.74; 95% CI = 1.79, 4.20), depressed mood (OR = 1.50; 95% CI = 1.02, 2.20), and thoughts of suicide (OR = 1.64; 95% CI = 1.13, 2.38) among adolescent boys., Conclusions.

We conducted a pilot randomized trial with 65 families and tested an adapted version of the Strengthening Families Program: For Parent and Youth 10\u201314 that infused mindfulness principles and practices against the original program and a delayed intervention control group. Results of pre-post analyses of mother and youth-report data showed that the mindful parenting program generally demonstrated comparable effects to the original program on measures of child management practices and stronger effects on measures of mindful parenting and parent\u2013youth relationship qualities. Moreover, mediation analyses indicated that the mindful parenting program operated indirectly on the quality of parent\u2013youth relationships through changes in mindful parenting. Overall, the findings suggest that infusing mindful parenting activities into existing empirically validated parenting programs can enhance their effects on family risk and protection during the transition to adolescence.",

        "paperAbstract": "While existing literature has begun to explore risk factors which may predict differential response to marriage education, a history of couple infidelity has not been examined to determine whether infidelity moderates the impacts of marriage education. The current study evaluated self-report marital satisfaction and communication skills in a sample of 662 married Army couples randomly assigned to marriage education (i.e., PREP) or a no-treatment control group and assessed prior to intervention, post intervention, and at 1 year after intervention. Of these, 23.4% couples reported a history of infidelity in their marriage. Multilevel modeling analyses indicated that having a history of infidelity significantly moderated the impact of PREP for marital satisfaction, with a trend for a similar effect on communication skills. However, couples with a history of infidelity assigned to PREP did not reach the same levels of marital satisfaction after intervention seen in the group of couples without infidelity assigned to PREP, although they did show comparable scores on communication skills after intervention. Implications of these findings for relationship education with couples with a history of infidelity are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)",

The prevalence of SSD during redeployment, however, is unknown.\n\nDesign:\nCross-sectional study of a brigade combat team (n = 3152 US Army soldiers) surveyed 90\u2013180 days after completing a 6\u201315 month deployment to Iraq as part of Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF). Survey items targeted sleep habits and comorbid medical conditions. Multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to calculate adjusted odds ratios of medical comorbidities associated with SSD.\n\nSetting:\nUS Army Infantry Post.\n\nSubjects:\nAll soldiers from a redeploying brigade combat team participated in a health assessment between 90 and 180 days upon return to Ft. Lewis from Iraq.\n\nInterventions:\nNone.\n\nMeasurements and Results:\nA total of 2738 (86.9%) soldiers answered questions regarding self-perceived sleep and were included in the analysis. Mean sleep duration was 5.8 \u00b1 1.2 hours. Nineteen hundred fifty-nine (72%) slept \u2264 6 h, but only 16% reported a daytime nap or felt their job performance was affected due to lack of sleep. Short sleep was more common among soldiers who reported combat exposure. After controlling for combat exposure, short sleep duration (SSD) was associated with symptoms of depression, posttraumatic stress disorder, panic syndrome, and with high-risk health behaviors such as abuse of tobacco and alcohol products, and suicide attempts.\n\nConclusions:\nSSD is common among redeployed soldiers. Soldiers who experienced combat are at increased risk for persistent SSD and comorbidities associated with SSD. Efforts to reestablish good sleep habits and aggressive evaluation of soldiers with persistent SSD following deployment may aid in the prevention and management of associated medical conditions.",

However, there is little knowledge of the impact of deployment on the relationship of parents and their children. This systematic review examines findings from 3 areas of relevant research: the impact of deployment separation on parenting, and children's emotional, behavioral, and health outcomes; the impact of parental mental health symptoms during and after reintegration; and current treatment approaches in veteran and military families. Several trends emerged. First, across all age groups, deployment of a parent may be related to increased emotional and behavioral difficulties for children, including higher rates of health-care visits for psychological problems during deployment. Second, symptoms of PTSD and depression may be related to increased symptomatology in children and problems with parenting during and well after reintegration. Third, although several treatments have been developed to address the needs of military families, most are untested or in the early stages of implementation and evaluation. This body of research suggests several promising avenues for future research.",

This study draws on the emotional cycle of deployment model (Pincus, House, Christenson, & Adler, 2001) to examine the reunion period in military youth\u2019s own words. Individual interviews were conducted with 31 military youth (age range = 10 to 13 years old). Participants identified four changes to family life (RQ1), including spending time together, experiencing emotional tranquility, returning to patterns in place before deployment, and having difficulty reintegrating the service member into everyday routines. Some military youth reported that the reunion matched their expectations (RQ2), but others noted that the reunion fell short of their expectations or that they did not expect the returning service member to be so tired or so irritable. Participants also described four issues of uncertainty (RQ3), including questions about the service member\u2019s activities during deployment, reasons for joining and deploying, family life, and the possibility of future deployments. The article concludes by examining the theoretical and pragmatic implications of the findings.",

The present study aimed to examine prevalence rates of CG in a sample of treatment-seeking military service and members and veterans who served after September 11, 2001. Additionally, the study aimed to examine characteristics associated with CG as well as the association between CG and quality of life. In a sample of 622 military service members and veterans who served after September 11, 2001, 502 reported a significant loss (80.7%). Usable data were available for a total of 468 participants. Of these 468 participants, 30.3% (n = 142) met diagnostic criteria for CG, as defined by a score of 30 or more on the Inventory of Complicated Grief (ICG; Prigerson et al., 1995). We conducted a series of t tests and chi-square tests to examine the differences between individuals who met criteria for CG and those who did not. The presence of CG was associated with worse PTSD, d = 0.68, p < .001; depression, d = \u22121.10, p < .001; anxiety, d = \u22121.02, p < .001; stress, d = 0.99, p < .001; and quality of life, d = 0.76, p < .001. Multiple regression analyses examined the independent impact of CG on quality of life. Complicated grief was associated with poorer quality of life above and beyond PTSD, \u03b2 = \u2212.12, p = .017. In addition, in a separate regression, CG was associated with poorer quality of life above and beyond depression, \u03b2 = \u2212.13, p < .001. Overall, our findings highlight the impact of CG on this population, and have implications for assessment and treatment.",

        "paperAbstract": "Background: Children of military personnel face stress when a parent deploys. Objective: Our goal was to determine the effect of parental military deployment on the relative rate of outpatient visits for mental and behavioral health disorders in children aged 3 to 8 years. Methods: This was a retrospective cohort study. Records of children of active-duty personnel during fiscal years 2006 and 2007 were linked with their parent's deployment records. Mental and behavioral health visits were identified by using International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, codes. The incidence rate ratio (IRR) of visits per year according to parental deployment status was determined with random-effects negative binomial regression modeling with longitudinal data analysis. Results: A total of 642 397 children aged 3 to 8 years and 442 722 military parents were included. Mean child age was 5.0 years (SD: 1.9 years); 50.6% were male, and 68.0% were white. Ninety percent of the parents were male, and 90.5% were married; 32.0% of the parents were deployed during the study. There were 1 049 081 person-years with 611 115 mental and behavioral health visits (0.6 visit per year). The IRR of mental and behavioral health visits for children with a deployed parent compared with when a parent was home was 1.11 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.07\u20131.14; P < .001). IRRs of pediatric anxiety, behavioral, and stress disorders when a parent deployed were 1.14 (95% CI: 0.98\u20131.32; P = .095), 1.19 (95% CI: 1.07\u20131.32; P < .001), and 1.18 (95% CI: 1.10\u20131.26; P < .001), respectively. Older children and children with military fathers and married parents had larger increases in rates of mental and behavioral health visits during parental deployments. In contrast, the overall outpatient rate and rates of visits for other diagnoses decreased when a parent was deployed. Conclusions: Mental and behavioral health visits increased by 11% in these children when a military parent deployed; behavioral disorders increased 19% and stress disorders increased 18%. Rates especially increased in older children and children of married and male military parents.",

This article applies the relational turbulence model (Knobloch & Theiss, 2011a; Solomon & Theiss, 2011) to understand the difficulty military couples may experience upon homecoming. One hundred and eighteen military couples completed an online questionnaire once per month for the first 3 months upon reunion following wartime deployment. Multilevel modeling results indicated that people's depressive symptoms (H1), relational uncertainty (H2), and interference from partners (H3) predicted their difficulty with reintegration. A few partner effects were apparent as well. These findings illuminate the dynamics of the reunion period, extend the relational turbulence model, and suggest guidelines for helping military couples preserve well-being during reintegration following wartime deployment.",

This can increase psychological stress for service members. We examined three phases of the deployment cycle: predeployment, deployment, and reintegration to reveal risk and resilience factors that may impede or promote attachment relationships. We also explored the impact of predeployment preparation and deployment communication on service members\u2019 parenting stress at reintegration. We conducted (N = 30) semistructured interviews with fathers who were deployed within 2 years of the study, and whose youngest child was 6 years old or younger during the deployment. We found that military fathers whose families did not have preparation strategies for maintaining father\u2013child relationship during the deployment experienced more parenting stress after the deployment than did fathers whose families did use preparation strategies. All participants reportedly communicated with their children during deployment, although number of communication methods did not predict later parenting stress. The most common reintegration experiences were described as an adjustment period, parental stress, and time off of work. Strategies for building attachment as a means of promoting resilience throughout the deployment cycle are identified and discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)",

        "paperAbstract": "Objective: To determine if a diagnosis of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) was associated with primary care provider-diagnosed physical disease in the first 5 years post deployment. Methods: An examination of medical records of 4416 veterans of Operations Enduring Freedom and Iraqi Freedom (OEF/OIF) was conducted. Participants were veterans who served between September 11, 2001 and December 31, 2007, without prior combat exposure, and who utilized primary care services within the VA Healthcare Network of Upstate New York. Primary care provider-diagnosed International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Revision 9 (ICD-9) physical diseases were examined. Results: Adjusting for demographic characteristics and clinical factors (e.g., age, gender, depression, and substance use), PTSD was significantly associated with an almost two-fold increase of developing nervous system (odds ratio [OR], 1.98), musculoskeletal disease (OR, 1.84), and signs and ill-defined conditions of disease (OR, 1.78). A diagnosis of PTSD was significantly associated with increased odds of developing circulatory (OR, 1.29), hypertensive (OR, 1.38), and digestive system disease (OR, 1.34). Survival analyses showed that veterans with PTSD experienced early onset disease compared with veterans without PTSD; hypertensive (hazard ratio [HR], 1.56; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.19-2.04), circulatory, (HR, 1.36; 95% CI, 1.11-1.67), digestive (HR, 1.24; 95% CI, 1.08-1.43), nervous (HR, 1.81; 95% CI, 1.59-2.06), musculoskeletal disease (HR, 1.49; 95% CI, 1.32-1.67), and signs and ill-defined disease (HR, 1.70; 95% CI, 1.51-1.92). Conclusions: PTSD is associated with increased prevalence and onset of physical disease among OEF/OIF veterans within the early years post military service. Rising rates of PTSD may foreshadow an increase in lifespan morbidity and healthcare utilization in the coming years among OEF/OIF veterans.",

Design: Substance use prevalence rates were estimated from cross-sectional data obtained from nine self-report surveys administered to more than 150 000 active-duty service members world-wide over a 25-year period. Direct standardization was used to adjust for socio-demographic changes. Measurements: Measures included self-reported cigarette use, illicit drug use and heavy alcohol use in the 30 days prior to the survey. Heavy alcohol use was defined as drinking five or more drinks per typical drinking occasion at least once a week in the past 30 days. Findings: Cigarette and illicit drug use among military personnel declined sharply and significantly from 1980 to 1998. Heavy alcohol use decreased in the mid-1980s but was stable from 1988 to 1998. Both cigarette smoking and heavy alcohol use increased significantly between 1998 and 2002 and remained at those levels in 2005. Illicit drug use remained low. Logistic regression analyses indicated that trends were influenced by other factors besides socio-demographic changes across survey years. Conclusions: The military has made notable progress in decreasing cigarette smoking and illicit drug use, but has made less progress in reducing heavy alcohol use. Additional emphasis should be placed on understanding recent increases in substance use and on planning effective interventions and prevention programs to reduce use in this high-risk population.",

        "paperAbstract": "Substance use disorders, traumatic brain injury (TBI), and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) are common in military and civilian populations, and often occur together. A substantial proportion of military personnel misuse alcohol. Substance use disorders, TBI, and PTSD may occur together for several reasons. Alcohol use, for example, may be a cause or a consequence of TBI. Traumatic brain injury has been reported to be associated with PTSD, and PTSD may be associated with substance use disorders by an indirect association with TBI. However, PTSD is often associated with substance use disorders, presumably in the absence of TBI. The co-occurrence of behavioral health problems may place additional demands on treatments designed for one of these conditions in isolation. What is not clear is whether simple accommodations or other minor adaptations to treatment are all that is needed, or whether a fundamentally different treatment approach is required. The complexity of substance use disorders co-occurring with PTSD, TBI, or both may necessitate that new treatment concepts be developed to successfully address these combined disorders. A systematic program of research and, if indicated, treatment development is a high priority, particularly for formerly deployed military personnel who are experiencing TBI, PTSD, and substance use disorders.",

Of the influential factors, research has demonstrated that parental behaviors and the quality of the parent\u2013child relationship are important correlates of children\u2019s development of empathy and prosocial behavior. The current study examined the associations between different types of parental behaviors (i.e., parental knowledge, parental solicitation, and parental psychological control), \u201cbalanced connectedness\u201d in the parent\u2013child relationship, which allows for both closeness and autonomy, and empathy and prosocial behavior in adolescents. The participants were 335 married couples (more than 80 % European American) and their adolescent child (49.0 % female; 10\u201313 years). Data were collected at three time points for parental behaviors, balanced parent\u2013child connectedness, and adolescents\u2019 empathy and prosocial behavior, respectively. The results of structural equation modeling suggested that adolescents\u2019 perceptions of parental solicitation and parental psychological control may be associated with their empathy and prosocial behavior through their perceived balanced connectedness with parents. These findings suggest that enhancing balanced connectedness in the parent\u2013child relationship may contribute to promoting empathy and prosocial behavior in adolescents over time. Further, this study suggests that parental solicitation may play a role in adolescents\u2019 empathic and prosocial development, possibly depending on the quality of the parent\u2013child relationship.",

Growing research has linked peer victimization with substance use among youth; however, less attention has been devoted to the role of cyber victimization specifically, while controlling for peer aggression. Objective: This study examined the unique associations between cyber victimization and adolescent smoking and drinking, controlling for traditional peer victimization types and for peer aggression. Methods: Participants were 1064 9th\u201312th graders, who completed self-report measures assessing peer victimization, peer aggression, and the frequency of cigarette and alcohol use. Censored regression analyses were used to evaluate study aims. Results: Greater cyber victimization was related to greater smoking, drinking, and binge drinking, controlling for traditional forms of peer victimization, but not when controlling for peer aggression. Cyber aggression emerged as a unique correlate of all substance use outcomes. Conclusions: Cyber victimization and cyber aggression co-occur with adolescent cigarette and alcohol use; however, only cyber aggression demonstrates unique associations. Findings suggest that prevention programs for adolescent substance use might evaluate and potentially target adolescents\u2019 victimization and aggression, especially in the cyber realm. Adolescent substance use may be important to evaluate and monitor in anti-bullying and victimization interventions.",

Method We performed a secondary analysis of evaluation data from a large-scale service implementation of the FOCUS intervention collected between July 2008 and December 2013 at 15 military installations in the United States and Japan. We present data for 2,615 unique families (3,499 parents and 3,810 children) with completed intake and at least 1 postintervention assessment. Longitudinal regression models with family-level random effects were used to assess the patterns of change in child and parent (civilian and military) psychological health outcomes over time. Results Improvement in psychological health outcomes occurred in both service member and civilian parents. Relative to intake, parental anxiety and depression symptoms were significantly reduced postintervention, and these reductions were maintained at 2 subsequent follow-up assessments. In addition, we identified an improvement over time in emotional and behavioral symptoms and in prosocial behaviors for both boys and girls. We observed reductions in the prevalence of unhealthy family functioning and child anxiety symptoms, as well as parental depression, anxiety, and posttraumatic stress symptoms from intake to follow-up. Conclusion Longitudinal program evaluation data show sustained trajectories of reduced psychological health risk symptoms and improved indices of resilience in children, civilian, and active duty military parents participating in a strength-based, family-centered preventive intervention.",

This study examined willingness to disclose deployment- and combat-related experiences as a mediating mechanism underlying the linkage between intimate partner support and PTSD symptom severity in a sample of 76 U.S. Air Force service members deployed to Iraq in a year-long, high-risk mission. Airmen\u2019s reports of overall social support, and partner support specifically, significantly predicted concurrent postdeployment PTSD symptom severity. Subsequent mediation analyses demonstrated that level of disclosure of deployment- and combat-related experiences by service members to their intimate partners accounted for a significant portion of the relation between partner support and postdeployment PTSD symptom severity. The level of Airmen\u2019s disclosure was also inversely related to levels of relationship distress. Implications of these findings for prevention and intervention strategies and for further research are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)",

Diagnoses were further classified into 1 of 17 disorder categories.\n\nResults Overall, children with parental deployment represented an excess of 6579 mental health diagnoses during the 4-year period compared with children whose parents did not deploy. After the children's age, sex, and mental health history were adjusted for, excess mental health diagnoses associated with parental deployment were greatest for acute stress reaction/adjustment, depressive, and pediatric behavioral disorders and increased with total months of parental deployment. Boys and girls showed similar patterns within these same categories, with more diagnoses observed in older children within sex groups and in boys relative to girls within age groups.\n\nConclusions A dose-response pattern between deployment of a parent for OIF and OEF and increased mental health diagnoses was observed in military children of all ages.

The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of parental wartime military deployment on psychosocial symptoms as measured by parent and youth self-report on the Pediatric Symptom Checklist. During annual physicals at a large military pediatric clinic, parents (216) and youth (198) were surveyed about emotional and behavioral dif\ufb01culties and the current status of parental deployment. Parents reported more child psychosocial symptoms, and youth self reported more psychosocial symptoms if there was a currently deployed parent. Youth self-reports may be another way to identify psychosocial symptoms in at-risk military youth. These \ufb01ndings accentuate the importance of training providers who care for military youth to recognize and respond to their unique needs during parental deployment.",

Data were collected as part of a pre- and post-deployment screening program at a large Army medical treatment facility. Cases included 7251 active duty soldiers (6697 men and 554 women) who presented for their pre- and post-deployment screening from March 2006 to July 2009. Pre-deployment mental health symptoms were statistically controlled for in our analyses. We found significant gender differences in demographic variables, exposure to combat, and MST. Women reported greater exposure to MST than did men. Although men reported greater exposure to high-intensity combat experiences than women, results indicate that women are experiencing combat at higher rates than observed in prior cohorts. Men were more likely to report problem drinking, and women were more likely to report depression symptoms. There were no gender differences with respect to PTSD symptoms. Although we found few differences between women and men in the impact of combat stressors on mental health, there was a stronger association between injury and PTSD symptoms for women than for men. Our findings indicate that it would be useful for clinicians to be aware of this difference and assess for exposure to a full range of traumatic combat experiences, particularly injury, as not all types of combat experiences may be equally experienced by men and women returning from military deployments.",

Past-year DSM-IV mental disorders (depression, generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder, social phobia, PTSD, and alcohol dependence), lifetime exposure to 28 traumatic events, and work stress were assessed. Regular and reserve female personnel were less likely than males to experience deployment-related traumas, accidents, and several events involving violence (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] range 0.10\u20130.62). Women were more likely to endorse sexual trauma, partner abuse, and being stalked (AOR range 3.60\u201313.63). For work stress, regular force women reported higher levels of job demand and stress around social support than men, whereas regular and reserve force women reported less physical exertion. After adjusting for a range of covariates, regular female personnel were more likely than males to have PTSD (AOR 1.88, 99% CI 1.01\u20133.50), while reservist women were more likely than men to have depression, panic disorder, and any mood or anxiety disorder (AOR range 1.87\u20136.98). Both regular and reservist women had lower rates of alcohol dependence (AOR range 0.30\u20130.34).

Method The population-based Great Smoky Mountains Study assessed 1,420 participants from 11 counties in the southeastern United States up to 11 times between ages 9 and 26 years with the structured Child and Adolescent Psychiatric Assessment and its upward extension, the Young Adult Psychiatric Assessment. Results The U-shaped age prevalence curve for any anxiety disorder was the product of high levels of childhood separation anxiety and adult panic, agoraphobia, and generalized anxiety. More than 1 in 5 subjects met criteria for an anxiety disorder by early adulthood. In terms of cumulative comorbidity, there was evidence of overlap between anxiety disorders, but the level of overlap was generally consistent with what is seen among other common childhood disorders. All childhood anxiety disorders were associated with adverse functioning in at least 1 young adult functional domain, with the poorest outcomes for childhood generalized anxiety and DSM-III-R overanxious disorder. Conclusion Clinically significant anxiety is a common mental health problem to have had by adulthood. There was little evidence to support the consolidation of anxiety disorders, and some evidence to justify reintroduction of DSM-III-R overanxious disorder. The transition to young adulthood appears to be a key period for understanding the development of common adult anxiety disorders such as panic and agoraphobia.",

Bowlby's attachment theory (1969/1982, 1973, 1980) and related research are presented as a framework for understanding the development of these abilities.

        "paperAbstract": "OBJECTIVE: It remains unclear to what degree children show signs of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) after experiencing low-magnitude stressors, or stressors milder than those required for the DSM-IV extreme stressor criterion. METHOD: A representative community sample of 1,420 children, ages 9, 11, and 13 at intake, was followed annually through age 16. Low-magnitude and extreme stressors as well as subsequent posttraumatic stress symptoms were assessed with the Child and Adolescent Psychiatric Assessment. Two measures of posttraumatic stress symptoms were used: having painful recall, hyperarousal, and avoidance symptoms (subclinical PTSD) and having painful recall only. RESULTS: During any 3-month period, low-magnitude stressors occurred four times as often as extreme stressors (24.0% compared with 5.9%). Extreme stressors elicited painful recall in 8.7% of participants and subclinical PTSD in 3.1%, compared with 4.2% and 0.7%, respectively, for low-magnitude stressors. Because of their higher prevalence, however, low-magnitude stressors accounted for two-thirds of cases of painful recall and half of cases of subclinical PTSD. Moreover, exposure to low-magnitude stressors predicted symptoms even among youths with no prior lifetime exposure to an extreme stressor. CONCLUSIONS: Relative to low-magnitude stressors, extreme stressors place children at greater risk for posttraumatic stress symptoms. Nevertheless, a sizable proportion of children manifesting posttraumatic stress symptoms experienced only a low-magnitude stressor.",

Participants were 125\u2009U.S. military service members (age: M=29.6 years, standard deviation [SD]=8.9, range=18\u201356 years) who sustained a TBI, divided into two groups based on symptom criteria for postconcussional disorder (PCD): PCD-Present (n=65) and PCD-Absent (n=60). Participants completed a neuropsychological evaluation at Walter Reed Army Medical Center (M=9.4 months after injury, SD=9.9; range: 1.1 to 44.8). Factors examined included demographic characteristics, injury-related variables, psychological testing, and effort testing. There were no significant group differences for age, sex, education, race, estimated premorbid intelligence, number of deployments, combat versus non-combat related injury, or mechanism of injury (p>0.098 for all). There were significant main effects for severity of body injury, duration of loss of consciousness, duration of post-traumatic amnesia, intracranial abnormality, time tested post-injury, possible symptom exaggeration, poor effort, depression, and traumatic stress (p<0.044 for all). PCD symptom reporting was most strongly associated with possible symptom exaggeration, poor effort, depression, and traumatic stress. PCD rarely occurred in the absence of depression, traumatic stress, possible symptom exaggeration, or poor effort (n=7, 5.6%). Many factors unrelated to brain injury were influential in self-reported postconcussion symptoms in this sample. Clinicians cannot assume uncritically that endorsement of items on a postconcussion symptom checklist is indicative of residual effects from a brain injury.",

The purpose of this study was to assess the association between family income and children\u2019s physical fitness level and obesity prevalence for 8 racial/ethnic groups. Methods Data for 1,617,400 fifth-, seventh-, and ninth-grade children who took a physical fitness test from 2010 through 2012 in California were used in this cross-sectional study. Multiple linear and log-binomial regressions were used to test whether low family income (as indicated by eligibility for National School Lunch Program) was associated with physical fitness level or obesity prevalence. Differences were tested by race/ethnicity while adjusting for age and sex. Fitness score was measured on a scale from 0 (least healthy) to 6 (most healthy). Results Average fitness score was 4.45 (standard deviation, 1.47). Prevalence of obesity was 20.3%, and 56% of children were classified as having lower family income. Lower family income (vs higher) was associated with lower fitness score (coefficient = \u22120.57; 95% confidence interval [CI], \u22120.62 to \u22120.53). Lower-income children had higher prevalence of obesity (relative risk = 1.81; 95% CI, 1.72\u20131.89) compared with higher-income children. These inverse associations were seen among American Indian, Asian, Pacific Islander, Filipino, Hispanic/Latino, African American, and white children and among children who were identified as being of 2 or more races/ethnicities. Conclusion Children with lower family incomes tend to have less healthy physical fitness status and have higher risk of obesity than children with higher family incomes. This information can be used to help set policies and provide programs aimed at improving fitness and decreasing obesity risk among low-income children.",

Research suggests guilt is a significant predictor of suicidal ideation among military personnel, and may be especially pronounced among those who have been exposure to combat-related traumas. The current study explored the interactive effect of direct combat exposure and guilt on suicidal ideation in a clinical sample of military personnel. Methods Ninety-seven active duty U.S. Air Force personnel receiving outpatient mental health treatment at two military clinics completed self-report symptom measures of guilt, depression, hopelessness, perceived burdensomeness, posttraumatic stress disorder, and suicidal ideation. Results Generalized multiple regression analyses indicated a significant interaction of guilt and direct combat exposure (B=.124, SE=.053, p=.020), suggesting a stronger relationship of guilt with suicidal ideation among participants who had direct combat exposure as compared to those who had not. The interactions of direct combat exposure with depression (B=.004, SE=.040, p=.926), PTSD symptoms (B=.016, SE=.018, p=.382), perceived burdensomeness (B=.159, SE=.152, p=.300) and hopelessness (B=.069, SE=.036, p=.057) were nonsignificant. Conclusions Although guilt is associated with more severe suicidal ideation in general among military personnel, it is especially pronounced among those who have had direct combat exposure.",

The survey was completed first at the formation stage (Time 1), and then eight to ten months later at the implementation stage (Time 2) of the coalition's development. Contrary to most previous research, a principal component analysis of the benefit and cost items yielded only one benefit component and one cost component. Also, the authors found that benefits and costs distinguished between the members of ''High'' and ''Low'' attendance groups only at Time 2. We consider the implications for coalition functioning, empowerment theory, and ''incentive/cost management.''

The sample consisted of 571 individuals (338 men). There were 128 participants (22.2%) who indicated that their partners were unfaithful during their most recent deployment. Of the remaining 443 participants, 168 (37.8%) indicated that they were concerned that their partners might have been unfaithful. Individuals who indicated that their partners were unfaithful exhibited higher levels of posttraumatic stress symptomatology (\u03b2 = .08; f2= .18) and depression symptom severity (\u03b2 = .09; f2 = .14), compared to individuals who did not indicate that their partners were unfaithful. For both men and women, reported infidelity was associated with mental health indirectly via postdeployment life stressors, whereas infidelity concerns were indirectly associated with mental health via postdeployment life stressors for men only. Findings suggested that infidelity can have a significant impact on combat-exposed veterans\u2019 mental health and highlight the need for additional research on this understudied topic within the military population.",

The Department of Defense\u2019s Military Health System (MHS) is one of the largest healthcare providers in the United States, serving approximately 9.2 million active duty service members, retirees, spouses, and children. The annual cost to the MHS for morbidities associated with being overweight exceeds $1 billion. The preschool age has been suggested as an opportune time to intervene for the prevention of obesity. Thus, this study investigated the current level of technology usage by military service member families and assessed their needs and interests in health/nutrition information. This needs assessment is crucial for researchers/educators to design further studies and intervention programs for obesity prevention in military families with young children. Materials and Methods: In total, 288 military parents (233 Army and 55 Air Force) at two military bases whose children were enrolled in military childcare centers in the southwestern United States participated in a Technology Usage in Military Family (TUMF) survey in 2013. Results and Conclusions: Overall, both bases presented similar technology usage patterns in terms of computer and mobile device usage on the Internet. Air Force base parents had a slightly higher knowledge level of nutrition/health information than Army base parents. The TUMF survey suggested practical ways such as mobile applications/Web sites, social networks, games, etc., that health educators can use to disseminate nutrition/health information for obesity prevention among military families with young children.",

A unique consideration in military couples is the concept of meaningfulness of service, or the value service members and their partners place on military service in spite of the sacrifices it requires. In a sample of 606 Army couples, the authors used path analysis to examine how male service members\u2019 and female spouses\u2019 perceived meaningfulness of service added to the prediction of marital satisfaction in both members of the couple, when accounting for service members\u2019 PTSD symptoms. Spouses\u2019 perceived meaningfulness of service was linked with higher marital satisfaction in spouses, regardless of service member\u2019s perceived meaningfulness of service. Service members\u2019 perceived meaningfulness of service was also associated with increased marital satisfaction in service members, but only when their spouses also perceived higher meaningfulness. There were no significant interactions between service members\u2019 PTSD and either partner\u2019s perceived meaningfulness. Implications for enhanced attention to spousal perceptions of meaningfulness of service are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)",

Social workers have highlighted the power of grassroots school community initiatives that address risk issues among youths while empowering the community (see http://www.thecommunityguide.org). However, researchers have focused on evidence-based programs implemented in a top-down, prescriptive manner. Often, when programs are implemented across entire cities, some schools may not have the need for such programs or the ability to implement them effectively. This study presents a grassroots process in which a military-connected school used a data-driven approach to assess its needs and devise a school- and community-wide antibullying initiative, Because Nice Matters (BNM). The results, drawn from local data on bullying rates from one military-connected high school, suggested a decrease in various forms of bullying during the course of BNM. In addition, results from a survey of parents and teachers showed that BNM had enhanced bullying awareness. Overall, the study findings indicate the value of grassroots efforts and a whole-school mind-set in antibullying efforts, in which parents, teachers, and other school stakeholders work together to address bullying among all students, both military and non-military.",

It is unknown, however, whether these deployment stressors lead to increased dependent medication use and health care utilization. Objective: To determine whether the deployment of Army active duty members (sponsors) is associated with changes in dependent health care utilization. Design: A quasi-experimental, pre-post study of health care patterns of more than 55,000 nonpregnant spouses and 137,000 children of deployed sponsors and a comparison group of dependents. Measures: Changes in dependent total utilization in the military health system, and separately in military-provided and purchased care services in the year following the sponsors\u2019 deployment month for office visit services (generalist, specialist); emergency department visits; institutional stays; psychotropic medication (any, antidepressant, antianxiety, antistimulant classes). Results: Sponsor deployment was associated with net increased use of specialist office visits (relative percent change 4.2% spouses; 8.8% children), antidepressants (6.7% spouses; 17.2% children), and antianxiety medications (14.2% spouses; 10.0% children; P < 0.01) adjusting for group differences. Deployment was consistently associated with increased use of purchased care services, partially, or fully offset by decreased use of military treatment facilities. Conclusions: These results suggest that emotional or behavioral issues are contributing to increased specialist visits and reliance on medications during sponsors\u2019 deployments. A shift to receipt of services from civilian settings raises questions about coordination of care when families temporarily relocate, family preferences, and military provider capacity during deployment phases. Findings have important implications for the military health system and community providers who serve military families, especially those with children.

After controlling for pre-deployment function, poorer physical function after deployment was associated with older age, more physical symptoms, blunted systolic blood pressure reactivity and being injured. After controlling for pre-deployment function, poorer mental function after deployment was associated with younger age, lower social desirability, lower social support, greater physical symptoms and greater PTSD symptoms.\nConclusions: Combat deployment was associated with an immediate decline in both mental and physical function. The relationship of combat deployment to function is complex and influenced by demographic, psychosocial, physiological and experiential factors. Social support and physical symptoms emerged as potentially modifiable factors.",

The study applied a modified ABCX model of family stress adaptation developed by McCubbin, Thompson, and McCubbin (1996). A sample of 779 BCT recruits were surveyed before training began. At the end of training, data was collected on those recruits who had been discharged before completion of training. Statistical measures of association were used to assess the relationship between the variables. Results supported all three of the hypotheses tested. Significant positive relationships were found between violence exposure and trauma symptoms, as well as levels of trauma symptoms and odds of early discharge. Patterns of association were found between types of exposure to community versus home violence and specific symptom clusters of traumatic stress. (C) 2004 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

Males married to service members make up only 5% of the military spouse population, but numbering close to 100,000, the group is large enough to have specific and significant needs. Gender assumptions play a large role in the experience of male military spouses and should be considered when designing military family programs. Many research studies done on active duty spouses are either done on females specifically, or male responses are too few to be statistically significant. Respondents had been married for an average of 10 years, had been dating their spouses for an average of 2 years prior to marriage, and more than half of the respondents had no prior military history of their own. Results of this study showed that respondents generally had medium to high levels of both marital satisfaction and interpersonal dependency, high levels of life satisfaction, and low levels depressive symptoms including feeling down, depressed or hopeless. This data is likely not representative of the larger male spouse population, as respondents had high levels of education and income, which could lead to fewer stressors. Although this data did not indicate a high level of distress among male military spouses, military family organizations should offer programs specifically aimed at including male spouses in order to increase family cohesion and reduce marital conflict which could result in improved mission readiness.",

Less is known about the longitudinal relationship between resources and distress. The authors addressed this issue in a study of 348 Gulf War returnees tested at 2 time points. Resources decreased and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms increased over time. Time 1 avoidance and family cohesion predicted PTSD symptoms at Time 2. Regression analyses revealed a bidirectional relationship over time between resources and PTSD symptoms. Time 1 resources predicted Time 2 psychopathology after accounting for Time 1 emotional distress. PTSD symptoms at Time 1 also predicted changes in coping and family relationships, even after accounting for Time 1 resources. Findings are consistent with the concept of a loss spiral (Hobfoll, 1989), in which resource factors and emotional sequelae to war stress exert reciprocal effects.",

Yet, few services are available for families, particularly during the formative preschool years, when healthy parent\u2013child relationships are crucial to the attainment of major socio-emotional milestones that form the foundation for later development. This paper describes the adaptation of a previously established military and trauma-informed preventive intervention, Families OverComing Under Stress (FOCUS) for use with families with a preschool-aged child (FOCUS for Early Childhood; FOCUS-EC). Grounded in theory and research on family resilience, FOCUS-EC aims to support parents as leaders of the family by providing developmental guidance and psychoeducation on deployment and reintegration, facilitate the construction of a family narrative, and enhance parenting strategies and the parent\u2013child relationship. Furthermore, FOCUS-EC was adapted for use in a telehealth platform, enabling clinicians to reach military and veteran families in their homes, which is particularly useful for high-risk civilian-dwelling military families (including Reserve and National Guard). Pilot work and ongoing data collection as part of a randomized control trial suggest that FOCUS-EC is acceptable and feasible for military and veteran families with preschoolers.",

A positive school climate\u2014where students perceive high levels of school connectedness, caring relationships and high expectations from adults, and meaningful participation\u2014is associated with lower rates of victimization in secondary public schools. Based on a survey of 7th, 9th, and 11th grade students (n=14,493) enrolled in six military-connected school districts (districts that have a significant proportion of military-connected students), this study explores victimization rates and the role of school climate, deployment, and school transitions in the victimization of military-connected students and their civilian peers. The findings indicate that deployment and school transitions were significant predictors of physical violence and nonphysical victimization. In addition, multiple school climate factors were significantly associated with physical violence and non-physical victimization. The authors conclude with a discussion of future directions for research on school climate, victimization, and military-connected youth.",

        "paperAbstract": "The general public has become increasingly interested in the health and well being of the children and families of military service members as the war in Iraq continues. Observers recognize the potential stresses or traumas that this population might undergo as a result of the military deployment or the possible injury or death of military family members. While such concern is welcomed, it is sometimes misplaced. Not infrequently, conclusions that are drawn are fraught with misunderstanding and bias based upon lack of understanding of the military community or a preconceived notion of the vulnerabilities of the population. This problem is compounded by the paucity of scientific study. In this article the authors review the strengths of military families as well as the unique challenges that they face. The authors also highlight parental deployment, parental injury and parental death as unique stresses to military children and families. Available and pertinent scientific information is reviewed. Clinical observations of children and families during the ongoing war in Iraq are presented.",

Although theory supports the influence of nonwork factors on turnover, our understanding of the degree to which nonwork factors relate to actual turnover behavior is not well developed. Using a sample of 5505 U.S. Army officers, we assessed the extent to which spouse career support related to reduced turnover four years later through work interfering with family (WIF) and job satisfaction as mechanisms. Results revealed that spouse career support decreased the odds of turnover, and WIF and job satisfaction sequentially mediated this relationship, with lower WIF and higher job satisfaction reducing the odds of turnover. Practical implications of using family support systems as retention interventions are discussed. Copyright \u00a9 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",

This study evaluates the impact of a family-centered prevention program, Families OverComing Under Stress Family Resilience Training (FOCUS), on the psychological adjustment of military children. Two primary goals include (1) understanding the relationships of distress among family members using a longitudinal path model to assess relations at the child and family level and (2) determining pathways of program impact on child adjustment. Multilevel data analysis using structural equation modeling was conducted with deidentified service delivery data from 280 families (505 children aged 3\u201317) in two follow-up assessments. Standardized measures included service member and civilian parental distress (Brief Symptom Inventory, PTSD Checklist\u2014Military), child adjustment (Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire), and family functioning (McMaster Family Assessment Device). Distress was significantly related among the service member parent, civilian parent, and children. FOCUS improved family functioning, which in turn significantly reduced child distress at follow-up. Salient components of improved family functioning in reducing child distress mirrored resilience processes targeted by FOCUS. These findings underscore the public health potential of family-centered prevention for military families and suggest areas for future research.

The impact of these factors on academic success is not fully understood, but is important for rehabilitation professionals, student advisors, and counselors. The current study examined the impact of resilience, depression, PTSD, and TBI on student Veteran academic outcomes, and whether the amount of student Veterans' military experience moderated the effect of these factors on academic performance. Seventy-seven student Veterans completed measures that assessed resilience, grade point average, academic disruptions, and symptoms of depression, PTSD, and TBI. Path analysis was used to determine the manner in which the variables influenced academic performance. Results indicate that student Veterans should not be viewed as a homogeneous group and their needs differ based on level of military experience. Academic disruption among less experienced Veterans was most associated with symptoms of depression, whereas academic disruption among more experienced Veterans was most associated with symptoms of TBI.

Veterans were identified as at risk for suicide and referred to the group following hospitalization on the inpatient psychiatric unit after an increase in suicidal ideation (SI), presentation to a provider with SI with a plan, or having made a suicide attempt. An archival chart review was performed on 359 patients who were referred to the Coping, Understanding, Support, and Prevention Group from 2009 through 2011. Documented risk of suicide was collected from the chart including: frequency of inpatient psychiatric hospitalization, visits to the emergency department or mental health walk in clinic for SI, reported SI in clinical notes, consults resulting from calls to the Veteran\u2019s Crisis Line, and assignment or removal of suicide risk behavior flags in the electronic medical record, for a period of 12 months prior to referral to the group and for a period of 12 months after referral to the group. Negative binomial regression models found that Veterans attending the support group showed a significantly greater reduction in frequency of endorsing SI post-referral compared to those who did not attend the group. Results imply that offering Veterans an ongoing therapeutic group format to give and receive support from peers also struggling with suicide risk factors is an effective way to reduce suicide-related thoughts.",

Even lengthy marriages were seen to be burdened due to the stress of reunion and men\u2019s wartime infidelity, increased inclination to drinking and aggressive behaviour. The article discusses the meaning and construction of marital expectations with respect to the development of post-war marital dissolution, and argues that wives in particular tried to adjust their marital expectations in accordance with the general developments in personal life and society. Especially in the case of older marriages, for the majority of women, divorce was seen more as means of personal survival than of seeking happiness, even in the urban areas. Although contemporaries feared that the marital institution was disintegrating, the majority of wives were willing to work to save, or endure, even troubled marriages.",

The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), however, has not been validated in this population. It is thus unknown if the PSQI can differentiate clinically significant sleep disorders from sleep disturbances resulting from military duties with restricted sleep periods. After a clinical evaluation and polysomnogram, participants (N = 148) were classified as having insomnia only, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) only, comorbid insomnia and OSA (CIO), service-related illnesses only (SRI\u2013; pain, depression, posttraumatic stress disorder, traumatic brain injury), and controls. Military personnel in the insomnia only, and the CIO groups had higher PSQI scores (13.5 \u00b1 2.8 and 14.7 \u00b1 3.5, respectively) compared to the controls (8.9 \u00b1 3.9). A cut-off score of \u226510 was optimal (90% sensitivity and 69% specificity) for determining clinically significant insomnia (\u226512 for CIO; 84% sensitivity, 77% specificity). In military personnel, a PSQI score >5 is not necessarily indicative of a clinically significant sleep disorder. The use of elevated cut-off PSQI scores are likely better suited to differentiate military personnel who require further clinical evaluation versus a more conservative sleep improvement protocol.",

The current study examined the psychometric characteristics of a newly developed, multidimensional tool for assessing the process and outcomes of deployment communication in a sample of 391 recently deployed male Army National Guard soldiers and their female intimate partners. The Deployment Communication Inventory (DCI) contains 6 Soldier and 6 partner scales that assess (a) frequency of communication, (b) nature of communication (Assurance/Support, Problem-Solving/Disclosure, and Conflict), and (c) perceived consequences of communication (Benefits and Costs). Scales demonstrated good internal consistency reliability and convergent validity with measures of relationship and family functioning and individual mental health.

According to the literature, spouses' empathy for their spouses can be a risk factor for their own mental health. However, this subject has not been examined among veteran couples. The current study therefore investigated both the direct and moderating contribution of females' cognitive and affective empathy to their own PTSS and depression symptoms, above and beyond the preexisting traumatic events of the women's own lives and the veterans' PTSS.; Method: Participants were 300 Israeli men who had served in the 2006 Israel-Lebanon War and their female partners, all of whom completed survey questionnaires.; Results: Results revealed that although cognitive empathy can play a positive role for the female in the aftermath of a traumatic event, affective empathy can potentially make a negative contribution to her distress. Women's education, in number of years, and their own previous traumatic life events, as well as veterans' levels of PTSS, were all found to make a direct contribution to females' PTSS and depression symptoms.; Conclusion: Findings support the theory that although higher empathy can play a positive role in military couples in which the male partner displays symptoms of PTSS symptoms, it can also contribute negatively to her distress.

        "paperAbstract": "Background: It is imperative to provide quality end of life (EOL) care for cancer patients. This entails minimizing aggressive measures at the EOL. Although rates of hospice utilization within the Veteran\u2019s Health Administration have improved, chemotherapy administration and intensive care unit (ICU) admission at the EOL, indicators of aggressive care, are not clearly declining over recent years. Methods: We identified 32,665 veterans diagnosed with stage IV lung, colorectal, or pancreatic cancer who died between 2009-2016 using VA cancer registry and Corporate Data Warehouse data through a novel EOL Dashboard Tool, which has been validated at multiple VA sites. This EOL tool reports three indicators; incidence of chemotherapy use in the last 14 days of life, ICU admission in the last 30 days of life and hospice admission or consult. Change over time, 2009-2016, was assessed using a repeated measures one-way ANOVA with post hoc test for linear trend of time for individual cancers and two-way ANOVA for all cancers combined. Results: Chemotherapy use in the last 14 days of life declined from 6.8% in 2009 to 4.4% in 2016 (p < 0.05). ICU admission in the last 30 days did not change significantly, from 13.3% in 2009 to 14.7% in 2016. The exception was stage IV lung cancer patients in whom ICU admissions increased from 12.9% to 16.2% (p = 0.01). Patients utilizing hospice services increased from 32.4% to 52.6% (p < 0.01). When combined for all years in an unadjusted analysis by VA regional network (VISN), chemotherapy use ranged geographically from 4.2% to 8.1% and for ICU admission from 8.4% to 18.0%. Conclusions: While chemotherapy administration at the EOL is declining for veterans with stage IV cancer, ICU admissions are unchanged and becoming more common in stage IV lung cancer despite increasing hospice utilization. Compared to prior Medicare reports, veterans have similar rates of EOL chemotherapy use and fewer EOL ICU admissions, adding to a growing body of literature showing that despite veterans having poorer health and utilizing more medical resources, the VA performs at or above non-veteran health care institutions on end of life cancer care. There is notable geographic variation in aggressive EOL care.",

        "paperAbstract": "As a result of efforts to end homelessness among U.S. veterans, more former service members are entering permanent supportive housing (PSH). While PSH has been successfully used to house homeless veterans, more research is needed about services beyond housing placement and retention. This study uses the Gelberg\u2013Andersen behavioral model for vulnerable populations to determine associations between predisposing, enabling, and need characteristics and recent service use (i.e., services to satisfy basic needs, occupational development, financial, healthcare, mental health) among unaccompanied homeless veterans (N\u2009=\u2009126) entering PSH in Los Angeles. Among the significant findings, as indicated using univariable logistic regression models, were veterans who had incarceration histories were more likely to utilize basic needs services, compared to those without incarceration histories. Veterans who received an honorable discharge were more likely to utilize occupational development services, compared to veterans with other discharge statuses. Veterans who had a case manager were more likely to utilize mental health services than those without a case manager, while those who received social security were less likely to utilize mental health services compared to veterans who did not receive social security. Veterans who met criteria for a psychological disability and veterans who met criteria for probable PTSD were more likely to use basic needs services and mental health services than veterans who fell below these thresholds. Clinical implications for social workers including \u201cequal access to services,\u201d \u201cenhancing economic stability,\u201d \u201cproviding safe and affordable housing with traumainformed services,\u201d and \u201ctraining service social workers to deliver well-informed linkages and services\u201d are discussed.",

        "paperAbstract": "Background: Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is a common and costly chronic disease in childhood. The SEARCH for Diabetes in Youth Study estimated annual incidence of T1D in the U.S. starting in 2002 and demonstrated a steady rise, through the most recent incidence reported at 20.1/100,000 in 2008. While more current U.S. incidence hasn\u2019t been published, European nations with national registries have reported a recent plateau in T1D incidence. Our study aimed to describe the incidence and prevalence of T1D in military dependent children using data from the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) Military Health System (MHS) electronic health record (EHR). Methods: This study used MHS Data Repository data to retrospectively review pediatric patients, ages \u226417 years, for evidence of T1D from January 1, 2007 to December 31, 2012. The MHS consisted of over 2.3M eligible children, on average, for review each year. T1D was defined as \u22651 insulin dispensing and \u22652 encounters with a diagnosis code of 250.x1 or 250.x3 within the study period. Annual incidence and prevalence were calculated for the studied years and stratified by sex, age group, and region of residence. The initial insulin dispensing event within the study period was considered index. Patients with no evidence of insulin in the 12-months prior to index were considered incident that year. A patient was considered prevalent in all subsequent years with an insulin dispensing event. Results: 5,616 pediatric patients with T1D were identified from 2007-2012 that were 52.7% male and had a mean (SD) age of 10.9 (4.2) years. Annual T1D incidence ranged from 20.7-21.3/100,000, and, each year, incidence was higher among males and highest among 10-14 year olds (30.9-35.2/100,000). Annual prevalence of T1D was 1.5/1,000 in all years with nominal difference between the sexes and the highest rate among 15-17 year olds (3.1-3.4/1,000). Discussion: The pediatric T1D incidence reported in this study is slightly higher than previously reported U.S. estimates. Peak incidence among 10-14 year olds as well as the male to female ratio correlates with previous studies and validates our findings. We feel this is a true representation of the incidence of T1D in the U.S. as our unique military EHR allows us to capture and record all patients and diagnoses under a single entity, thus making our data source similar to a true diabetes registry. Conclusion: Our data provide the most recent nationally representative incidence of T1D in children in the U.S. and reflect rates slightly higher than previously reported. Using the closed system of the DoD MHS, we feel capture of T1D within this population was near complete. This information could have significant impact on healthcare cost projections for those with T1D.",

Accordingly, the primary objective of the present research was to conduct the first GWAS of suicide attempts and suicidal ideation in a large and well-characterized sample of U.S. military veterans. The gene most significantly associated (p=9.28\u202f\u00d7\u202f10\u22127) with suicide attempts was the Potassium Calcium-Activated Channel Subfamily M Regulatory Beta Subunit 2 (KCNMB2) gene, which plays a key role in neuronal excitability. In addition, replication analyses provided additional support for the potential role of the ABI Family Member 3 Binding Protein (ABI3BP) gene in the pathogenesis of suicidal behavior, as numerous nominal associations were found between this gene and both suicide attempts and suicidal ideation. Additional work aimed at replicating and extending these findings is needed.",

However, descriptions of patterns of relationship functioning over time are lacking. Such information could advance an understanding of the course of relationships pre-, during, and postdeployment and be used to predict relationship outcomes and tailor clinical supports. In this study, we describe an adaptation of a life history calendar to collect detailed sexual relationship and life event histories from military Veterans. With a sample of 112 post-9/11-era Veterans, in the context of a broader assessment battery, lifetime sexual relationship histories were collected by the calendar and concurrently by a standard questionnaire. Assessment order was balanced, and the order effect on individual outcomes, and on agreement between assessments, was examined. Measures collected by the calendar were evaluated for retest reliability, agreement with the standard questionnaire, and construct validity. Results revealed highly variable partnering histories, and a more-than-typical number of lifetime partners reported by Veterans. Psychometric indices provided support for use of the calendar: selfreports were reliable over a 6-week retest period and correlations with theoretically related variables were stronger for variables measured by the calendar data than the same variables measured by standard questionnaire. Large discrepancies in self-reports between assessment methods among Veterans with more complex sexual histories highlighted the need for structured memory supports as provided by the calendar. Other advantages of calendar-derived histories over those assessed by standard questionnaire are discussed.",

It is assumed that differences in job types both within civil and military domains require different dimensions of adaptability competency. The present study investigates this assumption. The Dutch Adaptability Dimensions And Performance Test (D-ADAPT) was used to measure both the adaptability demands of jobs, and of self-assessed adaptability competency of employees. In addition, the predictive value of certain personality traits (openness, neuroticism, and conscientiousness) and other relevant personal characteristics (cognitive flexibility, learning goal orientation) on various adaptability dimensions was explored. Military personnel were found to estimate their adaptability competency as higher than civilians did. With respect to the civilian jobs, the adaptability demands varied across job types. This was not found in the set of military jobs, possibly due to a smaller variety of jobs included. This study also shows that a variety of personal characteristics predict different dimensions of adaptability. Cognitive flexibility was found to be the best predictor for adaptability in general. Openness turned out to be a good predictor within the civilian group, whereas neuroticism was a better predictor within the military group. Results of this study contribute to a better understanding of work adaptability and influencing personality characteristics. Practical implications for selection and training of personnel can be derived, based on the acquisition of adaptability competency that matches the type of job.",

This study involves the first steps in developing a multilevel approach to preventing relationship problems that integrates universal, selective, and indicated prevention/intervention. Such an approach has tremendous empirical support for parenting problems, but no similar program exists for couple problems. We conducted two studies with U.S. Air Force Security Forces members. Study 1 elicited the target population's topics of highest interest. For almost all topics, 70% to 95% of participants who desired information reported being underserved by current prevention offerings (i.e., not receiving needed information). Using the top topics generated in Study 1, we developed prevention information/action planning sheets on 18 relationship issues. In Study 2, we had AD members who gave feedback on the form and content of the sheets. Overall, AD members believed that the sheets were moderately to very useful and were presented well, had pithy but comprehensive information and conveyed the content well. Results imply that a multilevel approach may be a useful complement to formal services in meeting underserved military members' needs and that further research and development of this dissemination vector for evidence-based information is warranted.",

AIMS: To assess the impact of attitudes on treatment-seeking behaviours in soldiers returning from a combat deployment. METHOD: A sample of 529 US soldiers were surveyed 4 months (time 1) and 12 months (time 2) post-deployment. Mental health symptoms and treatment-seeking attitudes were assessed at time 1; reported mental healthcare visits were assessed at time 2. RESULTS: Factor analysis of the total time 1 sample revealed four attitude factors: professional concerns, practical barriers, preference for self-management and positive attitudes about treatment. For the subset of 160 soldiers reporting a mental health problem at time 1, and controlling for mental health symptom severity, self-management inversely predicted treatment-seeking; positive attitudes were positively related. CONCLUSIONS: Results demonstrate the importance of broadening the conceptualisation of barriers and facilitators of mental healthcare beyond stigma. Techniques and delivery models emphasising self-care may help increase soldiers' interest in using mental health services.",

While much attention has focused on the experiences of families with younger children with IDD, little is known about the family quality of life (FQOL) among families with transition-age youth and young adults. We examined the FQOL ratings of 425 parents with a child between 13\u201321 years of age with intellectual disability or autism to understand FQOL and the factors that may shape it. Overall satisfaction with FQOL was somewhat high for this sample, with some variability across domains. Higher FQOL ratings were predicted by lower frequency of challenging behaviors, lower support needs, and higher strength of parental religious faith. We present recommendations for research and practice focused on promoting quality of life during the transition period.",

Families are comprised of individuals who interact across levels in a socio-ecological system. Family resiliency does not develop through evasion of risk, but through successful application of protective factors to engage in adverse situations and emerge from them stronger. In an effort to move away from pathological labelling, this review provides a foundation for strength-based family interventions. Thirteen peer-reviewed databases were searched for articles and information regarding family resiliency. Careful review yielded 24 protective factors that foster resiliency across three distinct but interactive levels: individual, family and community. The protective factors identified in this review of the literature offer an excellent starting point for development of clinical interventions to support family resiliency.",

This paper reports a study of transitions in the use of informal and professional care using Andersen-Newman models of the predictive predisposing, enabling and need factors. The study has drawn on Longitudinal Ageing Study Amsterdam (LASA) data on the use of care and the contextual factors. The data were collected at three-yearly intervals from a random, sex- and age-stratified, population-based sample of adults aged 55-85 years. In summary, the findings for those who initially did not receive care were that almost one-third received some kind of care three years later, most of which was provided by informal care-givers. Need factors were important predictors of most transitions in care, and predisposing and enabling factors, such as age, partner status and income, also played a role. On the relationship between informal and professional care, evidence was found for both 'compensatory processes', i.e. informal care substitutes for professional care, and 'bridging processes', i.e. informal care facilitates professional care. In view of the increasing discrepancy between the demand for professional care and its supply, the significant impact of predisposing and enabling factors offers opportunities for intervention.",

The second part moves toward the examination of factors associated with psychological and marital adjustment in both couple partners. Here again, there exists a large diversity in empirical data and theoretical models informing this emerging area of interest. Nevertheless, cognitive variables such as coping skills are commonly seen as critical variables to explain the adjustment level in people with TBI and their spouse/caregivers. Concurrently with the discussion of the methodological issues and pitfalls encountered in this area of research, the conclusion provides suggestions of further steps to undertake in this endeavour toward a better understanding of the adjustment process following TBI.",

Methods: 126 young adolescents were recruited from the Northeastern USA. Each type of media use was assessed using survey questions, time use diaries, and ecological momentary assessment. The Beck Depression Index for Primary Care was administered at baseline and 1 year later as part of a questionnaire that also included items assessing the presence of household rules about TV and video games.  Results: Baseline use of mobile phones and TV viewing were associated with higher levels of depression 1 year later controlling for demographic information and baseline depression score. Having household rules about TV at baseline predicted lower levels of depression at follow-up.  Conclusions: Both TV viewing and mobile phone use may contribute to the development of depressive symptoms. Implementing household rules about the duration and content of TV could help reduce depression in young adolescents.",

Achieving the U.S. Army's vision for CSF required a robust information technology platform that was scaled to millions of users and that leveraged the Internet to enable global reach. The platform needed to be agile, provide powerful real-time reporting, and have the capacity to quickly transform to meet emerging requirements. Existing organizational applications, such as \"Single Sign-On,\" and authoritative data sources were exploited to the maximum extent possible. Development of the \"Soldier Fitness Tracker\" is the most recent, and possibly the best, demonstration of the potential benefits possible when existing organizational capabilities are married to new, innovative applications. Combining the capabilities of the extant applications with the newly developed applications expedited development, eliminated redundant data collection, resulted in the exceeding of program objectives, and produced a comfortable experience for the end user, all in less than six months. This is a model for future technology integration.",

This exploratory study describes the presence and availability of LGBT-affirming role models, and examines the relationship between the accessibility of role models and health outcomes among a community-based sample of LGBT youth. Methods A convenience sample of 496 ethnically diverse, 16\u201324-year-old LGBT youth was recruited to complete a computer-assisted interview, using standardized instruments validated with adolescents. The prevalence and characteristics of role models were described. Differences in subgroup distribution were assessed using Pearson \u03c72 test (p < .05). Differences in health outcomes for those with and without role models and the nature of those role models were determined using analysis of covariance models, with post hoc Bonferroni tests to probe significant global findings. Results Sixty percent of the participants reported having a role model, with younger participants significantly more likely to report having a role model. A majority of the participants reported having inaccessible role models, especially among younger participants. The presence and accessibility of a role model did not have a significant relationship to binge drinking, drug use, or sexually transmitted infection diagnoses; however, participants with inaccessible role models showed increased psychological distress versus those with accessible or no role models. Conclusions Inaccessible role models may not be sufficient for protecting youth from negative outcomes, and formal mechanisms for connecting LGBT youth with caring adults who can serve as role models, such as mentoring programs, are critical.",

Unfortunately, the concept of the learning organization is generally vague, and school personnel have few tools available to support its assessment and to inform intervention strategies. Using data from the population of employees in 11 middle schools in North Carolina and building on an earlier analysis, this study examines the reliability and validity of a new assessment tool for assessing schools as learning organizations: the School Success Profile Learning Organization. The results align with the conceptual model that informed the development of the measure, including support for the two hypothesized learning organization components: actions and sentiments.

Although the work includes both physical and psychological types of ambiguous loss, the focus is the aftermath of 9/11 (September 11, 2001), when the World Trade Center collapsed following terrorist attacks. On the basis of her previous work, the author was asked to design an intervention for families of the missing. She reflects on what she learned from this unexpected test and presents new propositions and hypotheses to stimulate further research and theory that is more inclusive of diversity. She suggests that scholars should focus more on universal family experience. Ambiguous loss is just one example. Encouraging researchers and practitioners to collaborate in theory development, she concludes that research-based theory is essential to inform interventions in unexpected times of terror, and in everyday life.",

AIM: This paper proposes some determinants of collective efficacy in small university groups. Group level hypotheses and research questions relating collective efficacy to collective cognition activities, task interdependence, self-efficacy for group work, and collective orientation were posited. SAMPLE: The sample comprised 145 university students in 40 work-groups. METHOD: A two-phase longitudinal design was employed in the context of university student groups. All groups were required to perform interdependent academic tasks. Aggregated variables were used after testing for within-group agreement. RESULTS: The results of multiple regression analysis provided some evidence that the more group members perceived themselves to be interdependent in the early stages of group work and assigned their tasks interdependently during group processes, the more likely they were to develop high collective efficacy in the final stages of group work. Collective efficacy was also related to the group average of self-efficacy for group work especially when task interdependence was perceived to be high. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that forming groups with capable university students in group work, strengthening university students' perceptions of themselves as interdependent in the early stages of academic group work and assigning interdependent group tasks during group work may contribute to the development of high collective efficacy.",

The percentage of cases of maltreatment that are known to FAP, however, is uncertain. Thus, the objective of this retrospective study was to estimate the percentage of U.S. Army dependent children with child maltreatment as diagnosed by a military or civilian medical provider who had a substantiated report with FAP from 2004 to 2007. Medical claims data were used to identify 0\u201317year old child dependents of soldiers who received a medical diagnosis of child maltreatment. Linkage rates of maltreatment medical diagnoses with corresponding substantiated FAP reports were calculated. Bivariate and multivariable analyses examined the association of child, maltreatment episode, and soldier characteristics with linkage to substantiated FAP reports. Across 5945 medically diagnosed maltreatment episodes, 20.3% had a substantiated FAP report. Adjusting for covariates, the predicted probability of linkage to a substantiated FAP report was higher for physical abuse than for sexual abuse, 25.8%, 95% CI (23.4, 28.3) versus 14.5%, 95% CI (11.2, 17.9). Episodes in which early care was provided at civilian treatment facilities were less likely to have a FAP report than those treated at military facilities, 9.8%, 95% CI (7.3, 12.2) versus 23.6%, 95% CI (20.8, 26.4). The observed low rates of linkage of medically diagnosed child maltreatment to substantiated FAP reports may signal the need for further regulation of FAP reporting requirements, particularly for children treated at civilian facilities.",

The research was an ex post facto design utilising a cross-sectional methodology. Path analysis was used to determine the structural effect of neurobehavioural problems on family functioning and psychological distress. Forty-seven female and 17 male spouse/caregivers of partners with severe TBI were recruited. Spouse/caregivers who reported partners with TBI as having high levels of behavioural and cognitive problems experienced high levels of unhealthy family functioning. High levels of unhealthy family functioning were related to high levels of distress in spouse/caregivers, as family functioning had a moderate influence on psychological distress. Furthermore, indirect effects of behavioural and cognitive problems operating through family functioning intensified the level of psychological distress experienced by spouse/caregivers. Additionally, spouse/caregivers who reported high levels of behavioural, communication and social problems in their partners also experienced high levels of psychological distress. This study was significant because the impact of TBI on the spouse/caregiver from a multidimensional perspective is an important and under-researched area in the brain injury and disability field.",

Maternal history of depression was associated with all three types of negative cognitions in offspring; maternal parenting style and stressful life events significantly incremented the prediction of teens' negative cognitions beyond maternal depression. Adolescents' self-worth was significantly predicted by low maternal acceptance. Attributional style was associated with maternal attributional style for child-focused events, and significantly predicted by maternal psychological control and negative life events. Hopelessness was predicted by high levels of stressful life events, particularly among youth with low self-worth.",

Mother and child behaviours related to emotion communication were coded based on videotaped mother\u2013child interactions in a sample of 87 ten- to twelve-year olds, and children reported on their anxiety symptoms. Mothers of more anxious children were less supportive in that they engaged more in psychologically controlling behaviours designed to manipulate the child's emotional state, exhibited less warmth and interest in the child, and were less elaborative during conversations about an emotionally negative event. Further, more anxious children showed greater affect intensity and lower congruency of emotions and behaviours, and were less engaged in the conversation. Examining the role of child gender did not change the results significantly. Mother and child emotion communication behaviours each explained significant variance in child anxiety. The results showed that how mothers and children approached emotion-related conversations is important for child anxiety, and highlighted the need to consider mother and child behaviours related to emotion communication in assessment and interventions with anxious children.",

Design A model of combat exposure, social environment, internalizing symptoms, and externalizing behaviors was tested in a military unit following a fifteen-month deployment to Iraq. The sample included 1,397 soldiers assessed four month post-deployment; 589 of these soldiers were assessed again nine months post-deployment. Results Externalizing behaviors were highly stable over the five-month post-deployment period. Both social environment and internalizing symptoms were significantly associated with level of externalizing behaviors at four months and nine months post-deployment, but combat exposure alone significantly predicted change in externalizing behaviors over the follow-up period. Conclusions Results suggest the need to broaden the scope of interventions targeted to combat veterans and have implications for care providers and military leaders.",

Women also scored significantly higher on all four factors examined: Re-experiencing, Avoidance, Emotionally Numb, Hyperarousal. More women than men were distressed by combat experiences that involved some type of violence, such as being wounded, witnessing or engaging in acts of cruelty, engaging in hand-to-hand combat, and, to a lesser extent, handling dead bodies. Men who had been sexually abused had a greater number of symptoms and were consistently more distressed than women on individual symptoms and symptom factors.",

In the current study, we examined administrators' reasons for adopting an evidence-based parenting program and service providers' use of and adherence to this program in community agencies. Surveys were completed online by 63 administrators and 215 service providers from 69 different agencies. Although the majority of trained service providers used the program, a significant minority (25.6%) had not delivered it since completing training. The average adherence rate reported by the service providers who used the program was 85.9%; the most common explanations provided for omitting session objectives were that they did not have enough time in session and because they did not consider the activities relevant for the parents they were seeing. Implications and suggestions for psychologists involved in the implementation of parenting programs are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)",

To investigate whether mindfulness may reduce school-related stress, interviews were conducted with 26 parents of children with intellectual and developmental disabilities who completed a mindfulness-based stress reduction intervention. Participants were asked about their stress during meetings with the school, use of mindfulness strategies in communicating with the school, and the impact of such strategies. The majority of parent participants reported: special education meetings were stressful; they used mindfulness strategies during IEP meetings; and such strategies affected parents' perceptions of improvements in personal well-being, advocacy, family-school relationships, and access to services for their children.

The sample consisted of 239 veterans of different service eras and their intimate partners. Veterans and partners reported their physical and psychological IPA perpetration and victimization over the past 6 months. Methodological improvements over prior concordance studies included the use of clinician-assessed PTSD symptoms and the assessment of relationship attributions via observational coding of couples\u2019 conflict interactions. Results suggested low to moderate levels of agreement between veterans and partners and indicated that relationship satisfaction was associated with reporting less IPA than one\u2019s partner reported, replicating prior concordance findings. Previous concordance findings with self-reported PTSD symptoms were also reproduced in the current study using clinician-assessed PTSD symptoms. Veterans\u2019 PTSD symptoms were associated with reporting less IPA than their partners reported and partners\u2019 PTSD symptoms were associated with reporting more IPA than the veterans reported. Additionally, we found an association between relationship attributions and reporting discrepancies. For both dyad members, making more positive and less negative relationship attributions was associated with reporting less IPA than one\u2019s partner reported. Findings underscore the difficulty of obtaining objective self-reports of adverse behavior, and highlight factors that may influence such reports. Clinically, this information could be used to better identify cases in which obtaining collateral reports of IPA are particularly warranted.",

It is therefore essential that practitioners develop reflective skills not only in relation to their clients and the organizational context in which they are employed, but also in relation to their presence within a community and the community's perception of the practitioner's presence. The role of community within child and youth care practice is explored in relation to the professional issues that can arise for practitioners. It is argued that practitioners both use and contribute to the communities in which they work and that, therefore, an active engagement with communities will require the practitioner to be aware of the implications of their presence with respect to culture, power and community conventions. Finally, the possibility of expanding the role of the practitioner to incorporate community capacity building is also explored. Child and youth care practice is ideally situated to contribute proactively to community capacity as in most communities, capacity issues are very much related to living with children and youth.",

Part I of the book examines the psychological family, or each person's mental representation of family, which may exist in addition to the family in which one actually lives. Each chapter in n Part II of the book contains a discussion of one of the six dimensions that Boss suggests are facilitative of resilience for the victims of ambiguous loss. In Part III of the book, Boss provides a brief epilogue that focuses on the self of the therapist. In this section she invites the reader to examine her or his own experiences of ambiguous loss as a prerequisite for working with others who have been similarly affected. This book represents a real tour deforce, the crowning achievement of a brilliant career. Whether as clinician or as researcher, Pauline Boss offers us much to think about and to work with as only someone with her background and experience can do.",

Surprisingly, one area that has not been fully explicated is the role that EBPs play in promoting community integration. In this paper. we explain how community integration is a unifying concept providing direction and vision for community mental health for people with SMI. As one crucial aspect of the recovery process, community integration clarifies the link between EBPs and recovery. We propose an alternate view, grounded in the empirical literature.. to the assertion by Anthony, Rogers, and Farkas [2003, Community Mental Health Journal, 39, 101-114] that \"EBP research has rarely demonstrated a positive impact on recovery related outcomes.\"",

Research found that trauma survivors with higher levels of anger also report more severe PTSD overall. Studies also support a relationship between PTSD severity and dissociation. Only one prior study of sexual assault survivors by Feeny, Zoellner, and Foa (2000) examined the relationships among dissociation, anger, and PTSD. While Veterans have been found to report high levels of anger and dissociation, the relationship between these factors and PTSD has not been examined among Veterans. This paper examines the relationship among anger, dissociation, and PTSD in treatment-seeking Veterans who presented for evaluation at the PTSD Clinic in the VA Ann Arbor Healthcare System during a four year period. Anger and dissociation predicted PTSD, hyperarousal, and avoidance/numbing severity while dissociation predicted intrusive severity. The implications of these results for clinical practice are discussed.",

The results demonstrate wide variation in the profile and attitudes of these three groups. In the context of an increasingly competitive marketplace of professional associations and high turnover rates among members in NCFR, it is concluded that professional role diversity involves both opportunities and challenges for NCFR, and represents a possible integrative and unifying theme for the organization.",

Guided by the principles of patient- and family-centered care, hospital-based caregivers developed a program to provide bereavement support for parents through phone calls and mailings. The aim of the present qualitative phenomenological study was to understand how parents experienced participating in this bereavement program. Method: A total of eight parents from six families participated in a focus-group evaluation of the two-year hospital-based bereavement program. Two social work clinicians/researchers independently analyzed the transcript of the focus group to define themes. Results: Four themes were identified: (1) lived experience of grief, (2) importance of relationships with the hospital-based team, (3) bereavement support from hospital-based providers, and (4) extending bereavement care. Significance of Results: Participants indicated the value of ongoing communication and connection with members of the healthcare team, who were often central to a family's life for years during their child's cancer treatment. Parents also provided suggestions for extending bereavement support through continued contact with providers and informal annual gatherings, as well as through a peer (parent-to-parent) support program.",

        "paperAbstract": "Aim: This paper is a report of a review of nurses' roles and their perceptions of these roles in decision-making processes surrounding artificial food and fluid administration in adult patients. Background: Of all caregivers, nurses have the closest and most trusting relationship with severely ill patients and their families during the entire end-of-life care process. As a result, nurses become closely involved in complex ethical decision-making processes concerning artificial administration of food or fluids for these patients. Data sources: We searched seven electronic databases (1990-2007) and examined the reference lists of relevant papers. Review methods: This mixed methods review was conducted with guidance of the United Kingdom Centre for Reviews and Dissemination guidelines on systematic reviews. Results: Although their direct impact is limited, nurses play a significant indirect role during decision-making processes. Because of their unique position, they often initiate decision-making processes, function as patient advocates and provide guidance, information and support to patients and families. Although nurses considered their role to be very valuable, they felt that their role was not always defined clearly or appreciated. Whether nurses experience decision-making processes positively depended on several contextual factors. Conclusion: Given their knowledge and practice skills, nurses are in a prime position to contribute valuably to decision-making processes. Nevertheless, they remain sidelined. For nurses to receive sufficient recognition, their decision-making tasks and responsibilities need to be clarified and made manifest to other participants.",

Historically, however, little emphasis has been placed on family-based interventions in general, and parenting interventions in particular, with returning service members. This paper provides an overview of research on the associations between combat deployment, parental adjustment of service members and spouses, parenting impairments, and children's adjustment problems, and provides a social interaction learning framework for research and practice to support parenting among military families affected by a parent's deployment. We then describe the Parent Management Training-Oregon model (PMTO()), a family of interventions that improves parenting practices and child adjustment in highly stressed families, and briefly present work on an adaptation of PMTO for use in military families (After Deployment: Adaptive Parenting Tools, or ADAPT). The article concludes with PMTO-based recommendations for clinicians providing parenting support to military families.",

For this study, 290 professionals participated in a national web-based survey; participants answered three open-ended questions about ways to involve siblings, positive experiences with siblings, and challenges in working with siblings. Professionals reported person-level and systems-level supports to encourage sibling involvement. Also, professionals reported enjoying working with cohesive families of individuals with IDD and witnessing the benefits that siblings bring to their brothers and sisters with IDD. Challenges in working with siblings included: lack of sibling involvement, systemic barriers, and caregiving burden. Implications for future research and practice are discussed.",

Although most military personnel returning from recent deployments will readjust successfully to life in the United States, a significant minority will exhibit PTSD or some other psychiatric disorder. Practitioners should routinely inquire about war-zone trauma and associated symptoms when conducting psychiatric assessments. Treatment should be initiated as soon as possible, not only to ameliorate PTSD symptoms but also to forestall the later development of comorbid psychiatric and/or medical disorders and to prevent interpersonal or vocational functional impairment. If evidence-based practices are utilized, complete remission can be achieved in 30%-50% of cases of PTSD, and partial improvement can be expected with most patients. We can all look forward to future breakthroughs that will improve our capacity to help people with PTSD.",

The issue is a reminder that the understanding of military children should be balanced, recognizing the risks that they endure as well as the strengths that they possess and skills that they develop through those experiences. An emphasis on strengths and positive development of children through the inherent risks of military life provides the pathway for creating effective preventive interventions that can sustain children through challenging times. Research on military children will not only benefit this population of American young; it can contribute both to a general understanding of their human development, and also to our knowledge of other populations of American children.",

        "paperAbstract": "Objectives: Women veterans are at high risk for intimate partner violence (IPV), which has previously been defined as psychological, physical, or sexual violence from an intimate partner. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recently added stalking to its uniform definition of IPV, but little is known about the occurrence of stalking victimization among women veterans who experience IPV, its overlap with other forms of IPV, and its contribution to posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptomatology among this population.; Methods: Lifetime intimate partner stalking, as well as physical, sexual, and psychological IPV, was assessed as part of a larger study of women veterans who completed a 2014 Web-based survey (75% participation rate). Women with a history of IPV or stalking (55%, n = 225) completed the PTSD Checklist-5 to assess PTSD symptoms related to IPV and items assessing military sexual trauma and combat exposure.; Results: Among 225 women veterans with a history of IPV, approximately 64% (n = 145) reported lifetime stalking by an intimate partner. Women who experienced both stalking and other forms of IPV were 4.2 times more likely to experience probable PTSD than were women who experienced IPV without stalking, odds ratio (OR) = 4.18, 95% confidence interval (CI) [1.91, 9.13]. After adjusting for military sexual trauma and lifetime sum of other types of IPV, women who experienced partner stalking remained 2.5 times more likely than women without a history of partner stalking to experience probable PTSD, OR = 2.49, 95% CI [1.07, 5.78].; Conclusions: Stalking from an intimate partner is a common form of IPV experienced by women veterans that strongly contributes to risk for probable PTSD. In addition to other forms of IPV, identification and treatment efforts should attend to stalking victimization among this rapidly growing population.

Background Rates of lower extremity (LE) musculoskeletal injury are reportedly higher in professional and collegiate athletes following concussions. However, there is a paucity of evidence on this relationship outside of high level athletes. Objectives Examine the risk of acute LE musculoskeletal injury in Soldiers within 2 years of an incident concussion compared to matched non-concussed Soldiers. Methods This study used the medical encounter and personnel data of active duty U.S. Army Soldiers from 2005-2011. Incident concussions were identified using International Classification of Disease 9th Revision (ICD-9) codes in medical encounter data of all Soldiers from 2005-2009. One non-concussed Soldier in the Army during the same month was matched on age, sex, rank, length of service, deployment status, and military career field to each concussed Soldier. A hazard ratio (HR) and 95% confidence interval (95%CI) was calculated for the risk of LE injury within 2 years of an incident concussion. Monthly HRs were compared to identify differences in injury rates between the groups, and a HR for the period of greatest difference was also calculated. Results N=23,044 individuals (11,522 concussed and 11,522 non-concussed) were included in this study. Within 2 years of concussion, the hazard of LE injury was 38% greater compared to non-concussed Soldiers (HR=1.38, 95%CI[1.30,1.46]), while the 15-month hazard was 45% greater (HR=1.45, 95%CI[1.36,1.56]). Conclusions The rate of LE musculoskeletal injury among this population of physically active adults is higher following concussion, and the risk remains elevated for more than a year following injury.

Over time, changes in perceived leadership and cohesion were significantly associated with corresponding changes in stigma/BTC levels. Stigma/BTC content was similar in both surveys; fear of being viewed as weak and being treated differently by leaders was most frequently endorsed while thinking less of a help-seeking team member and unawareness of potential help sources were least common.Conclusion: Effective leadership and cohesion building may help to reduce stigma/BTC in military personnel. Mental health awareness and promoting the discussion of mental health matters may represent core elements of supportive leader behaviour. Perceptions of weakness and fears of being treated differently represent a focus for stigma/BTC reduction.",

Objective: We evaluated whether BI predicts decreases in drinking 6 months after a positive screen for unhealthy alcohol use. Method: We enrolled patients who recently screened positive for unhealthy alcohol use during a routine screen in Veterans Health Administration primary care. We conducted medical record review to assess whether providers documented advice to reduce or abstain, feedback about risks to health, feedback about how patient drinking compares to norms or recommended limits, and discussion of drinking-related goals. BI elements were coded from 7 days before the date of the positive screen to 60 days after. We conducted baseline and 6-month follow-up telephone interviews to assess change in past 30-day drinking. We fit regression models examining each BI element and another model for the total count of instances of any combination of elements. Results: Of the 327 patients included, 86% had at least one documented instance of receiving advice, 86% had risk feedback, 55% had normative feedback, 38% had goal discussion, and 75% had three or more instances of any combination of elements of BI. None of the individual BI elements, nor the total number of instances, were significantly associated with decreased drinking. Conclusions: Results suggest that provider documentation of elements of BI and increasing numbers of instances of BI elements were not associated with decreased heavy drinking at 6-month follow-up among patients identified with unhealthy alcohol use.",

Emerging research suggests that both distress tolerance and impulsivity may underlie this comorbidity. However, to our knowledge no studies have examined whether these 2 constructs predict outcome in PTSD-SUD treatment. The current study investigated whether pretreatment distress tolerance and impulsivity predicted posttreatment PTSD and cravings severity in a sample of 70 veterans receiving concurrent treatment for PTSD and SUD in a residential day treatment program. Veterans completed measures of symptom severity before and after treatment. Results demonstrated that pretreatment distress tolerance predicted posttreatment PTSD severity while controlling for pretreatment PTSD. By contrast, pretreatment impulsivity was not predictive of posttreatment PTSD while controlling for pretreatment values. Neither distress tolerance nor impulsivity predicted posttreatment cravings severity. The findings support the notion that distress tolerance may help to explain the co-occurrence of PTSD and SUD and suggest that targeting this construct in PTSD-SUD treatment may be important for successful outcomes.",

Love and War by Tom Digby offers a lens onto how this debate came about by considering the social constructions of men, masculinity and heterosexuality through capitalism and the military. Love and War is a critical interrogation of men\u2019s role in romantic heterosexual relationships. It is a philosophical take on masculinity and how militaristic ideas of masculinity shape sexuality and romance. Tom Digby argues that the social constructions of gender in militaristic \u2018Western\u2019 societies are inherently oppositional in order to fuel society\u2019s need for military projects. In interrogating Western societies\u2019 militaristic projects, Digby argues that the gender binary is fundamental to military projects. The maintenance of heterosexuality\u2014institutionalised using biological arguments\u2014is possible under the guise of assumed oppositional genders.",
